    <title>The countdown is on for Omnitracs Outlook 2019</title>
    <link>https://www.omnitracs.com/blog/countdown-omnitracs-outlook-2019</link>
    <description>&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://omnitracsoutlook.com/"&gt;Omnitracs Outlook 2019&lt;/a&gt; is right around the corner and we couldn’t be more excited for this year’s event. Industry leaders across the transportation and logistics community will be joining us to talk about compliance, next-gen technology, last-mile innovation, and the Omnitracs product roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve assembled several breakout sessions and a diverse panel of keynote speakers to share their industry knowledge.  Among them are Raymond P. Martinez, the sixth Administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), Dan Baker, a nationally known speaker, teacher, and consultant to the trucking industry, and Kylla Lanier, the deputy director and co-founder of Truckers Against Trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re attending in-person or following along on social media, here are some of the themes you can look forward to this year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparing for last-mile delivery pressures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offering superior last-mile delivery options continues to be a hot topic for Outlook attendees and this year is no different. Consumer demand for immediate and efficient delivery is putting immense pressure on transportation and logistics companies. In fact, a &lt;a href="https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Report-Digital-%E2%80%93-Last-Mile-Delivery-Challenge1.pdf"&gt;recent survey from Capgemini Research Institute&lt;/a&gt; found that over half of consumers would switch to a competitor offering faster service. At Outlook, attendees will learn about the latest in last-mile innovations — from drones to cargo bikes — and hear ideas about utilizing same-day management tools. You’ll have the opportunity to speak with our product team and customers about how to most effectively use your routing and dispatching solutions to stay ahead of the last-mile delivery race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making the most of your data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data has become a major differentiator in performance and strategic business decisions for many fleets. But with more data available than ever before, prioritizing what matters for your company can seem impossible. This year, we’ve prepared several sessions on how companies can more effectively leverage their data across a variety of our solutions. You’ll also have the chance to demo our new application, Omnitracs Reporting &amp;amp; Analytics, and speak with some of our beta customers that are using this product. You will leave this conference with a plethora of new information on how to keep costs down, retain drivers, and improve overall operations for your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staying ahead of the compliance game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we are a year in on the U.S. ELD Mandate and preparing for the upcoming Canadian Mandate, compliance is top of mind for many of our Outlook attendees. Many fleets are still using Automatic On-Board Recording Devices (AOBRDs) or other technology that will need to be updated by the end of this year if they want to remain compliant. But don’t panic — we’ve brought in our top compliance experts and customers to help companies prepare for these regulatory changes and any necessary migrations to support them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting your Omnitracs update for 2019 and beyond  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, we announced &lt;a href="https://www.omnitracs.com/company/press/omnitracs-announces-unified-fleet-management-platform-omnitracs-one"&gt;Omnitracs One&lt;/a&gt;, a game-changing, unified fleet management solution to improve operations from the first mile to the last. Outlook attendees will have a chance to preview the customer portal and hardware before it’s available to the public later this year. You’ll also have a chance to hear about our &lt;a href="https://www.omnitracs.com/company/press/omnitracs-builds-amazon-alexa-skill-ps-transportation"&gt;exciting innovations in voice technology assistants&lt;/a&gt; and how these new capabilities are transforming communication for transportation and logistics companies. In addition to product updates, we will also discuss some larger technology trends like blockchain and their impact on the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Outlook, attendees will have multiple opportunities for hands-on training and customer Q&amp;amp;As across our solutions portfolio. Our &lt;a href="https://www.omnitracs.com/blog/visible-invisible-threats-how-trucking-industry-navigating-cybersecurity-landscape"&gt;Chief Security Officer Sharon Reynolds&lt;/a&gt; will also give attendees an update on the security landscape and identify ways for companies to build up their defense against potential vulnerabilities. &lt;a href="https://www.womenintrucking.org/"&gt;Women in Trucking’s CEO Ellen Voie&lt;/a&gt; will also share her take on continuing to bridge the gender gap in the transportation industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information on the various breakout sessions, view our &lt;a href="http://www.cvent.com/events/omnitracs-outlook-2019/agenda-a06d71ea11594f8cbdceaae646b7fefe.aspx"&gt;Outlook 2019 agenda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-image-featured field-type-image field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;img typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://www.omnitracs.com/sites/default/files/styles/blog_single/public/omnitracs_outlook_2019_logo_blog_featured_image.jpg?itok=OfD4_wL1" width="500" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title> 4 Ways mobile is driving improvements in trucking</title>
    <link>https://www.omnitracs.com/blog/4-ways-mobile-driving-improvements-trucking</link>
    <description>&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everywhere you look, you can see the effects mobile technologies have on our lives. According to &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/world-population-mobile-devices-2017-9"&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;, two-thirds of the world’s population regularly uses mobile devices to communicate, play games, and pursue a variety of hobbies. Additionally, more and more companies are allowing their employees to be mobile-based. By 2023, experts project that nearly &lt;a href="https://www.strategyanalytics.com/access-services/enterprise/mobile-workforce/market-data/report-detail/global-mobile-workforce-forecast-update-2017-2023"&gt;half of the U.S. population&lt;/a&gt; will be taking advantage of advanced technologies to work outside of an office — and virtually anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile innovations are impacting the trucking industry, as well. Drivers have long used cell phones for basic needs such as staying in touch with family during long drives or finding the best pizza shop on a route. But in recent years, fleet management apps have gotten smarter and more powerful, helping trucking companies become more productive, customer friendly, and responsive to their staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a closer look at how fleet managers are using mobile applications to improve their business processes in four key areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational efficiency &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the behaviors and inefficiencies that increase organizational costs and weaken productivity has been a constant struggle for transportation managers. Utilizing typical back-end systems to execute tasks — like plotting out optimal routes for drivers to follow — provides minimal certainty that routes are being executed according to plan. Without access to advanced technology, managers calculate costs per mile and costs per stop by hand, without knowing whether drivers veered off of their routes to hit a favorite lunch spot or visit a friend a few towns over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tools such as &lt;a href="https://www.omnitracs.com/products/omnitracs-routing-dispatching-compliance"&gt;Omnitracs’&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.omnitracs.com/products/omnitracs-routing-dispatching-compliance"&gt;mobile dispatching&lt;/a&gt; can help improve operational efficiency by allowing drivers to input data from the road and managers to track actual routes against prepared plans, monitoring costs and driver behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer satisfaction &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today’s competitive business environment, customers expect vendors to not only deliver products on time, but to offer alerts and mobile minute-by-minute tracking features. Consumers, especially around the holidays, want and need to know the exact location and status of their order to determine if it will arrive on time. Businesses of all types expect the same sort of transparency in their own ordering processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To facilitate this knowledge, customer service has never been more important. &lt;a href="https://info.microsoft.com/rs/157-GQE-382/images/EN-CNTNT-Report-DynService-2017-global-state-customer-service.pdf"&gt;Microsoft’s 2017 State of Global Customer Service Report&lt;/a&gt; found that 54 percent of all customers and 66 percent of customers between 18 and 34 had higher expectations for service in 2017 than in 2016. And it pays to keep customers in the loop. In 2017, U.S. companies &lt;a href="https://www.newvoicemedia.com/en-us/resources/serial-switchers-swayed-by-sentiment-how-bad-emotive-customer-experiences-are-costing-brands-billions"&gt;lost $75 billion&lt;/a&gt; from customers switching to competitors because of poor customer service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Order tracking applications are removing the confusion from the delivery process and keeping customer service levels high. Trucking companies use the apps to track drivers’ progress and head off a problem before it surfaces. Customers can utilize the apps to gain comfort that deliveries will make it on time. They also can check in to determine if an order might come in early to ensure their receiving depots are sufficiently staffed when orders arrive. Tracking apps can also help companies give time back to management, sales, and customer service staff that is typically spent handling customer inquiries related to their deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fleet visibility &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transportation managers have long struggled with poor visibility into the status of their fleet operations. With dozens — if not hundreds — of workers out in the field at the same time, it can be difficult to keep track of productivity and operational efficiencies. Using mobile dispatching or telematics tools, managers can measure how routes are executed against scripted plans and access potentially unsafe driver behavior information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These applications can track lane departure warnings to determine whether a driver often drifts, hugs the shoulder, or changes lanes without signaling. Managers can use the frequency of hard braking alerts to find out how aggressive or attentive a driver is on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of just counseling drivers on general ways to deal with these situations, data gives fleet managers the ability to get ahead of future problems. Managers can use data from mobile software as teaching tools. Rather than standardizing their training programs, managers can set up customized, consistent coaching techniques for every driver, focusing on areas of improvement and continuing to monitor subsequent driving behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worker productivity and engagement &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managers in the trucking industry are constantly looking for initiatives to help workers become more productive. &lt;a href="https://blog.devicemagic.com/increase-productivity-in-transport-and-logistics"&gt;Common strategies&lt;/a&gt; such as working longer hours, optimizing vehicle fleets and transport routes, and improving data collection and administration are options to improve productivity, but may not be the best solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another solution is, simply, to engage with workers more. A &lt;a href="https://www.officevibe.com/employee-engagement-solution/employee-feedback"&gt;recent Officevibe Employee Feedback study&lt;/a&gt; shows engaged employees are 27 percent more likely to perform well than those who are not. The same study found that a key way to engage employees is for managers to provide regular feedback. This can be done successfully using mobile tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How important is feedback? The study cited above shows workers are twice as likely to be actively disengaged if they’re ignored by their manager. Four out of 10 workers are actively disengaged when they get little or no feedback, nearly two-thirds of employees want more feedback, and 82 percent of employees appreciate receiving feedback, regardless if it’s positive or negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When drivers are off on routes, it’s easy for managers to slack off on the process of communicating and offering regular feedback. Mobile applications can provide a solution to this issue. Modern apps can be configured to provide guidance on the completion of tasks — verifying order quantities, collecting signatures, logging data — and offering feedback on how they’re performing relative to the day’s plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going mobile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile applications won’t solve every issue in the trucking industry, but they are providing helpful connections for companies looking for an edge. As technology continues to develop, management teams need to make mobile a bigger priority going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-image-featured field-type-image field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;img typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://www.omnitracs.com/sites/default/files/styles/blog_single/public/featured_image_2.1.19.jpg?itok=jBTMsZ32" width="500" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>4 Tips to reduce weather-related crashes</title>
    <link>https://www.omnitracs.com/blog/4-tips-reduce-weather-related-crashes</link>
    <description>&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/weather/q1_roadimpact.htm"&gt;U.S. Department of Transportation&lt;/a&gt; (DOT), more than 5.8 million vehicle crashes occur every year. Of those, approximately 21 percent, or just over 1.2 million, are weather-related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rain, snow, sleet, fog, and crosswinds can significantly impact a driver’s ability to safely navigate the roadways. It’s critical that motorists take the proper precautions to prepare for and adapt to all adverse conditions. While crashes can occur during even the most pristine driving situations, there are certain things that drivers can do to increase safety and reduce the risk of an accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the top four ways drivers can safely operate their fleets in hazardous conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be cognizant of the weather&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there’s nothing drivers can do to escape certain elements, there are approaches they can implement to improve their overall safety. First, they need to be aware of any current or upcoming weather conditions and adjust accordingly. This means taking steps to prepare their vehicles, such as refilling their wiper fluid, adding tire chains or traction mats, replacing lights, and more. Next, they should proceed with caution, reducing their driving speed, increasing following distance, being hyperaware of other vehicles, turning on signals earlier before merging, and removing any ice or snow from their trucks. While drivers need to always be aware of their operating times and delivery schedules, they should use their best judgement to determine if and when to take a break due to inclement weather. If it’s too dangerous to continue driving, they should look for a safe place to pull over and wait until it’s safe to resume their routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take the most pptimal routes &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor weather and driving conditions can cause congestion and increased travel time on the roadways. In fact, trucking companies or commercial vehicle operators (CVOs) &lt;a href="https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/weather/q1_roadimpact.htm"&gt;lose an estimated 32.6 billion vehicles hours&lt;/a&gt; every year due to weather-related congestion and traffic accounts for nearly 12 percent of truck delays across the country. Therefore, it’s important that drivers do what they can to account for delays and congested roads and avoid them if at all possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drivers can leverage advanced navigation tools to find and follow the most efficient routes. While some drivers may be very familiar with their routes or prefer more traditional forms of navigation, they can greatly benefit by utilizing advanced technology. Solutions leverage real-time data to automatically populate the safest, most efficient routes that avoid traffic delays and weather-related issues as much as possible. These tools can also give visibility into hazardous routes including roads that are not well maintained or have low clearances, weight limits, or size restrictions. By utilizing historical traffic conditions, this software can help drivers bypass routes that may take extra time in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid fatigue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting a good night’s rest may seem obvious, yet not all drivers make it a priority. The &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/drowsy-driving"&gt;National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&lt;/a&gt; estimates that drowsy driving was responsible for 795 deaths in 2017, 90,000 crashes in 2015, and 4,121 fatal crashes between 2011 and 2015. To avoid being tired behind the wheel, drivers should make sure to get an appropriate amount of sleep during their off-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;a href="https://www.omnitracs.com/the-eld-mandate"&gt;ELD Mandate&lt;/a&gt; has alleviated some pressures of driving at all hours, it’s important that drivers also make the conscious decision to pull off of the road and take a break during a long haul, if needed. The &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-news/the-problem-drowsy-driving"&gt;AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety&lt;/a&gt; reports that people who sleep 6-7 hours a night are twice as likely to be involved in a crash as those who sleep a full 8 hours. That extra hour is crucial to road safety. Fleets can help reduce the risk caused by fatigue by investing in &lt;a href="https://www.omnitracs.com/products/omnitracs-fatigue-model"&gt;technologies that leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning&lt;/a&gt; that identify high-risk drivers, and take action before it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remove distractions      &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When operating their vehicles, drivers need to worry about and consider a variety of factors, including their speed, other motorists on the road, how many hours they’re driving, and if they’re taking the most optimal routes. It’s crucial for drivers to remove any unnecessary distractions that may impair their abilities to operate their trucks safely. One of the most beneficial solutions: replace traditional communication tools with next-generation technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it’s critical for fleets to maintain constant communication with drivers, managing this while driving can be a tricky and somewhat dangerous task. However, new mobile communication tools are transforming the transportation industry completely. Now, fleets have access to advanced telematics devices that feature text-to-talk and hands-free capabilities, allowing operators to reach drivers at all times without requiring drivers to take their eyes off of the road or hands off of their steering wheels. Instead of relying on cell phones to contact supervisors, drivers can now rely on &lt;a href="https://www.omnitracs.com/products/omnitracs-driver-workflow"&gt;these robust messaging tools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are certain times that can be more dangerous than others for drivers on the road, there are ways they can reduce the likelihood of an accident. With the right processes and technology in place, you can give your drivers the tools they need&lt;a href="https://www.omnitracs.com/products/omnitracs-driver-safety-model"&gt; to operate and arrive safely&lt;/a&gt; at their destinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/blog/tags/safety" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Safety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item odd"&gt;&lt;a href="/blog/tags/vehicles" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Vehicles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-image-featured field-type-image field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;img typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://www.omnitracs.com/sites/default/files/styles/blog_single/public/safe_driving_blog_image.jpg?itok=gxwyGuNp" width="500" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>Top 2018 themes in last mile innovation </title>
    <link>https://www.omnitracs.com/blog/top-2018-themes-last-mile-innovation</link>
    <description>&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;2018 was a monumental year for the transportation industry. From existing companies unveiling innovative solutions, to new companies announcing next-generation technologies, it seemed as if a new offering was introduced to the market every day. Why? To provide the winning solution that meets consumer demands and revolutionizes the last mile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today’s digital era, it’s clear that consumers expect convenient, fast, and personalized experiences in nearly every aspect of their lives, including how they shop for and receive products. To remain successful, it’s critical that transportation companies are always one step ahead, implementing the next big thing to redefine the consumer journey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the industry made significant steps forward, providing a glimpse into the advanced solutions that will transform delivery services for years to come. Below are the top trends leading the race in last-mile innovation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emphasis on energy efficiency &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To excel in this rapidly evolving landscape, it’s important that companies continuously reassess processes and implement changes in real time. When it comes to fleet management, this is especially true. To succeed, companies not only have to maintain operations, but they must also place consumer preferences at the epicenter of all company decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, both FedEx and UPS identified the need for more cost-effective and energy-efficient last-mile solutions. First, &lt;a href="https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/FedEx-hydrogen-fuel-cell-van-pilot/522449/"&gt;FedEx unveiled its pilot program&lt;/a&gt; to test a hydrogen fuel cell, zero-emission delivery van, which allows drivers to reach more customers and reduce time wasted spent refueling. In addition, &lt;a href="http://fortune.com/2018/05/09/ups-electric-trucks/"&gt;UPS announced a partnership&lt;/a&gt; with technology company Arrival to develop a pilot fleet of electric vehicles. With zero tailpipe emissions and a range of 150 miles, the trucks will be outfitted with Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) to help identify driver fatigue and improve overall safety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic partnerships &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another trend we’ve seen recently is top retailers investing in in-house delivery programs. Keeping innovation top-of-mind, many brands are partnering with, or acquiring, prominent technology companies to up level their delivery offerings and reinvigorate the consumer experience. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/walmart-partners-with-delivery-logistics-platform-bringg-on-last-mile-grocery-delivery/"&gt;Walmart, for example, recently partnered with&lt;/a&gt; delivery logistics platform Bringg, to develop Spark Delivery. The program, still in a pilot stage, leverages a crowdsourced model, allowing drivers to list their availability and be matched with online grocery orders and navigational information. Likewise, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/18/18146841/target-shipt-same-day-delivery-service-amazon-walmart"&gt;Target announced at the end of 2018 that Shipt&lt;/a&gt;, its same-day delivery service, will expand into new product categories, bringing items to consumers within as little as one hour.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advancements in autonomous delivery &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, discussions around &lt;a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/technology/last-mile-delivery-in-search-of-solutions"&gt;autonomous technology&lt;/a&gt; have flooded the market, being hailed by some as the perfect solution for last-mile deliveries. However, it will likely be some time before we see self-driving trucks completely take over the roads. While developers are hard at work to refine the technology and develop smart roadways, many companies have entered the market with smaller-scale offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.restaurantdive.com/news/doordash-hits-the-road-with-autonomous-vehicle-delivery/545271/"&gt;DoorDash partnered with Cruise&lt;/a&gt; to bring driverless vehicles to San Francisco to complete orders, and &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/kroger-to-begin-sending-robots-for-last-mile-grocery-delivery/"&gt;Kroger released a pilot program&lt;/a&gt; to test autonomous delivery in select areas. Also, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/5/31/17413836/alibaba-driverless-robot-deliver-packages-speed"&gt;Alibaba unveiled a new robot&lt;/a&gt; that will carry deliveries to consumers, featuring a storage locker that can only be opened with facial recognition, while &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/09/19/renault-unveils-autonomous-delivery-concept-ez-pro-with-customizable-robo-pods/https://venturebeat.com/2018/09/19/renault-unveils-autonomous-delivery-concept-ez-pro-with-customizable-robo-pods/"&gt;Renault discussed plans&lt;/a&gt; to develop an autonomous fleet that will hold robo-pods to reduce traffic and urban congestion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developments in drone technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, there has also been a lot of conversation around drone technology and its impact on the last mile. While drones present unmatched benefits to the transportation industry, such as the ability to reach rural areas faster, easier, and safer than traditional fleet delivery methods, we’re still years away from mainstream use. However, several companies recently indicated they’re working on advancing the technology and overcoming regulatory hurdles, revealing plans to implement drones for last-mile deliveries in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Israeli-based &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/01/08/flytrex-raises-7-5-million-to-expand-drone-delivery-to-north-carolina/"&gt;Flytex announced $7.5 million in funding last year&lt;/a&gt;, which the company shared will be used to improve its existing drone delivery technology and launch a pilot program in North Carolina to test deliveries from restaurants to companies. Also, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/alphabet-unit-tests-new-system-to-identify-airborne-drones-11547417035"&gt;Alphabet’s Inc Wing unit shared a new concept&lt;/a&gt; that is aimed at tracking drones with advanced software applications, giving operators and government agencies access to real-time data that could help overcome some regulatory hurdles.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s ahead &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While advancing the last mile was a major focus in 2018, there’s no signs of the industry slowing down any time soon. At the Consumer Electronic Show (CES) in Las Vegas earlier this month, many companies introduced both new solutions and plans that will further disrupt processes and bring new innovations to the market. Some of the most prominent: &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/03/segway-unveils-a-more-durable-electric-scooter-and-autonomous-delivery-bot/"&gt;Segway’s durable electric scooter and autonomous delivery bot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.truckinginfo.com/322661/ford-announces-last-mile-delivery-pilot-program-at-ces"&gt;Ford’s self-driving delivery pilot program with Postmates&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/robot-delivery-dog-ces-2019/"&gt;Continental’s robo dogs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As technology continues to develop, it’s evident that traditional practices of getting goods to the consumer will be completely disrupted. Before we know it, ordinary solutions that have been in place for decades will be uprooted and replaced with remarkable services that are difficult to even fathom, let alone implement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, to keep pace with today’s rapidly evolving landscape, it’s critical fleets have a strong pulse on new offerings and implement the solutions that are right for their unique needs. And, while this could seem daunting, fleets can lean on solution providers for assistance. To ensure success, fleets should work with their customer support teams to continuously identify specific needs, select available services to resolve gaps and streamline operations, seamlessly implement solutions, train employees, provide educational resources, and more.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/blog/tags/last-mile" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Last mile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item odd"&gt;&lt;a href="/blog/tags/innovation" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Innovation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-image-featured field-type-image field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;img typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://www.omnitracs.com/sites/default/files/styles/blog_single/public/gettyimages-933450112.jpg?itok=JQdbV6ar" width="500" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>Kicking off a discussion about last mile and football</title>
    <link>https://www.omnitracs.com/blog/kicking-discussion-about-last-mile-and-football</link>
    <description>&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every industry has its own jargon — its closely guarded insider terms that outsiders can’t and simply won’t understand. But there is a language that brings us all together. It’s football. Football terms find their way into every industry — seemingly every conversation. &lt;em&gt;We’re going to punt on this project. Let’s huddle up and figure out a way to get this thing over the goal line&lt;/em&gt;. The terms translate well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truth is, we in fleet management use football terms as often as anybody. Managers “coach up” new workers. When we say we need to do an “end-around” or mobilize for a “two-minute drill,” everybody gets it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of which brings us to a discussion about how companies can improve performance in the “last mile.” Last mile is not a football term. Could that be the problem? We’ve done so well applying football terms to other areas of society, maybe we could solve the last-mile conundrum if we just wore down the defense with more football terms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we go. We’ll kick off the discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entering the Red Zone &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is easy. The last mile is the Red Zone — the stretch inside a football opponent’s 20 yard line where your team is threatening to score. In daily distribution, the Red Zone is often more congested than the rest of the route. There’s a limited amount of time to make the delivery. A lot can go wrong. A driver needs technology to help him or her navigate successfully within the Red Zone. &lt;a href="https://www.omnitracs.com/solutions/planning-delivery"&gt;Omnitracs’ software&lt;/a&gt; can alert the driver when he or she enters a defined zone (can be a mile or two — doesn’t have to be 20 yards). It can furnish the driver with key information — like where to park in a certain locale and whom to ask for at the customer location. When you enter the Red Zone, you need to score. Technology will help get you six points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoiding Turnovers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interceptions and fumbles derail drives in football. Likewise, “turnovers” can complicate “drives” that reach distribution’s last mile. When you deliver product to a customer, you have to make sure that it’s fully accounted for and intact. Technology can play a role in ensuring that this happens. Using fleet management software, office personnel key in order details for each delivery in the office backend system. Order counts are often checked for accuracy at the customer site. Fleet management software communicates to the driver where to deliver product in the event an attendant is not on duty. Drivers also have the ability to take a picture on their mobile device to make sure the delivery is logged in the back-office system. And the back office can monitor driver performance using a telematics solution, making sure he’s not taking corners too tight or braking too hard.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing the Clock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Football coaches do their best to use the game clock to their advantage — slowing down drives when they’re ahead and speeding things up late in games if their team is behind. In last-mile delivery, routers and dispatchers try to manage their own time clocks to benefit not only the business but the workers themselves. &lt;a href="https://www.omnitracs.com/blog/future-last-mile-delivery"&gt;Last-mile route optimization software&lt;/a&gt; does this. Managers consolidate information about the day’s deliveries and the system creates the most efficient routes. This ensures deliveries make it to their destinations on time, keeps drivers from having to work overtime, and increases overall customer satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staying in Bounds &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In football, the play is over once the ball is carried, kicked, or thrown out of bounds. Preparing for last-mile deliveries, companies can implement programs to keep drivers “in bounds,” or, more specifically, on their routes. Drivers have some leeway to venture off route to grab a meal at a favored spot — but there are limits. Vehicle management system software tracks locations and distances traveled. If a driver heads 50 miles off route to hit a particular pizza shop, dispatchers can spot it and have a conversation in real time. Last-mile distribution, like football, requires discipline. Staying in bounds can keep gas costs in line and make sure deliveries get done on time.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating a Game Plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before every game, football coaches gather and assemble a plan to put their team in the best position to succeed. The plan is not written in stone days before the team takes the field. It gets edited and reedited, then finalized based on weather conditions and injuries. Distributors create their own game plans. They look at a variety of factors — like number of orders, locations of deliveries, conditions of trucks, and availability of drivers. But they can’t lock down the specifics until “game day.” Food and beverage orders often come the day before, so having a flexible system that optimizes routes gives distribution “coaches” an edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calling an Audible &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having flexibility is one thing. Being able to change an order on the fly is quite another. On the football field, the coach picks a play, but then the quarterback is free to “call an audible” if he thinks he can exploit a defensive scheme. At a daily distributor, last-minute changes happen all the time. If a restaurant increases its order after the truck leaves the terminal, a dispatcher can update the order, find the closest truck with that product, and call the driver with the change — all in real time. If a customer needs to change a delivery along the same route — shifting a few cases from one customer to another — the dispatcher can update the plan and alert the driver on his mobile device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoiding ‘Delay of Game’ Penalties  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody likes penalties — especially ones that, with a little preparation and common sense, can be avoided. In football, “delay of game” penalties cost a team five yards. In daily routing, &lt;a href="https://www.omnitracs.com/blog/five-biggest-challenges-haunt-last-mile-deliveries"&gt;delays can cost a company much more&lt;/a&gt;. Much of the responsibility rests with the routers and dispatchers. They need to budget enough time to get their drivers to a target destination. If a driver late for one delivery, chances are they’re going to be late for all of them. Distributors can help drivers manage situations by maintaining a rich trove of information on specific routes and specific drop-off locations. They can create and update route plans, keep detailed pointers on customer preferences (deliveries at Gate A in the morning, Gate B in the afternoon), and have customer contact information handy if a loading dock isn’t open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achieving a High QB Rating&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One could argue that a football quarterback has more influence over a team’s performance than any other position in sports. To measure his performance, analytics pros have devised a “quarterback rating,” taking into account all kinds of measures of efficiency. Daily distributions companies use analytics to measure and improve the performance of their own sets of QBs — the drivers. Systems track each driver’s statistics dealing with with on-time deliveries, completing deliveries within the time allowed, avoiding accidents, time spent time idling the engine, fuel efficiencies achieved, and general safety records. Savvy operators use the numbers to promote skilled drivers, spot areas for training and implement fleet-wide initiatives to jump-start performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Playing Strong Safety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A “strong safety” in football plays defense. He’s primarily responsible for covering tight ends and stopping the run. Distribution companies can &lt;em&gt;put an emphasis&lt;/em&gt; on “strong safety” by creating tight, disciplined safety programs that are bolstered by technology. &lt;a href="https://www.omnitracs.com/blog/what-are-benefits-fleet-telematics-lets-find-out"&gt;Telematics solutions&lt;/a&gt; help companies track their two most important assets — people and equipment — to make sure both are operating as safely and efficiently as possible. They measure if the driver is following safety guidelines — avoiding dangerous behaviors such as speeding, idling, harsh cornering, and harsh braking. They track vehicle performance and can be set up to deliver alerts when a vehicle is due for maintenance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/blog/tags/last-mile" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Last mile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item odd"&gt;&lt;a href="/blog/tags/delivery" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Delivery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/blog/tags/routing" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Routing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-image-featured field-type-image field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;img typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://www.omnitracs.com/sites/default/files/styles/blog_single/public/gettyimages-508969318.jpg?itok=TYdK3Akb" width="500" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>Bikes, scooters and drones – Oh my! New options in last mile delivery</title>
    <link>https://www.omnitracs.com/blog/bikes-scooters-and-drones-oh-my-new-options-last-mile-delivery</link>
    <description>&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Craving your favorite candy that you can’t find in the local grocery stores? In all likelihood, you can still have it in your hands tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon’s promise of fast and free delivery has completely disrupted the fulfillment and delivery process. Across the transportation industry, everyone from regional fleets to truckload carriers are re-thinking their delivery options. The American Trucking Associations &lt;a href="https://www.truckinginfo.com/295788/how-e-commerce-trends-are-affecting-final-mile-logistics-1"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the average length of a haul has now dropped to a historic low of 499 miles, which shows how much emphasis is being put on last mile delivery options. The desire to meet consumer demands for speed is putting pressure on the entire supply chain, especially during busy periods like the holiday season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, it’s not all doom and gloom. Over the past few years, there has been more focus on innovative last mile solutions to help solve this logistics headache. Here are some trends to keep an eye on in 2019:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bicycles &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A favorite childhood pastime is also becoming a viable last mile opportunity. Bicycles offer an extremely efficient – and cheap – option for last mile delivery, which is why companies like UPS have started investing in them as a possible solution. These human-powered machines have a strong historical track record: UPS actually began as a bike delivery service, so in some ways the company is returning to its roots. Recently, it decided to &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ups-delivery-tricycle-seattle/"&gt;test its electric bicycle&lt;/a&gt; in Seattle, a city notorious for vehicle traffic. Could these tricycles be the answer to all our last mile hurdles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While bicycles may solve some problems, there are limitations to this delivery method. Bikes work well in established, urban areas, but aren’t feasible in many parts of the country. The actual size of the bike also limits what types of products can be delivered. While it’s worth keeping an eye on bicycles, they won’t solve every last mile hurdle in the coming year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scooters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scooters also present an affordable and quick last mile delivery option, but the concept still has a long way to go. In Atlanta, a scooter-sharing company called Bird announced it was &lt;a href="https://atlanta.curbed.com/2018/11/29/18117973/bird-lime-uber-scooter-shareable-last-mile-regulations"&gt;launching a scooter delivery service&lt;/a&gt;. Uber and Lyft also &lt;a href="https://www.myajc.com/blog/commuting/lyft-the-latest-company-join-atlanta-scooter-wars/oMfGSAfIP3OqfVFVofqFHJ/"&gt;announced scooter-sharing services&lt;/a&gt;, ensuring that Bird has its fair share of southern competition. However, scooters have even more size limitations than bicycles and they present additional safety hazards. The City of Atlanta is discussing stricter &lt;a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/atlanta-eyes-regulation-booming-electric-scooter-business/R1TR7ZUp5EeLbmSIevX25I/"&gt;scooter regulations&lt;/a&gt;, which may slow this two-wheeled option from having a national impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bicycles and scooters might be viable options for urban last mile delivery, but what about the rest of the country? Enter drones. Logistics and transportation companies are testing out drone solutions for a variety of situations, including rural areas. Usually, these solutions are aerial vehicles that are controlled by humans from a central location. However, companies are also looking at robots that have the ability to climb and travel to the hard-to-reach locations. For companies, this could mean that a driver manages several drones who handle his or her last mile deliveries.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, don’t expect a drone takeover in your neighborhood tomorrow. There are many &lt;a href="https://www.omnitracs.com/blog/examining-potential-impact-drones-trucking-industry"&gt;regulatory&lt;/a&gt; and cost hurdles that need to be addressed before we can expect a massive drone delivery strategy. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/1/4/14062654/drones-hacking-security-ftc-parrot-dbpower-cheerson"&gt;drones present a security threat&lt;/a&gt;, offering many opportunities for hacking and cyberattacks. Until the industry can overcome these hurdles, drones won’t completely solve the last mile problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will all the last mile problems be solved in 2019? No, but we’ve come a long way and are making more progress every day. In addition to drones, bikes and scooters, fleet management software has also greatly helped last mile delivery. Technology like &lt;a href="https://www.omnitracs.com/products/roadnet-telematics"&gt;telematics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.omnitracs.com/products/omnitracs-roadnet-anywhere-dispatching-proof-delivery"&gt;mobile dispatching&lt;/a&gt; allow fleet managers to have real-time updates on their drivers' delivery cycles. Being able to adjust schedules and expectations is extremely crucial to last mile success, and allowing fleets to deliver on the promise of speed. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Truck parking shortage is everybody’s problem</title>
    <link>https://www.omnitracs.com/blog/truck-parking-shortage-everybodys-problem</link>
    <description>&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of all the issues dividing drivers and carriers these days, perhaps the biggest one is the seriousness of the truck parking problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carriers put it way down on their list of issues — ranking it ninth in priority on the recently released &lt;a href="https://www.omnitracs.com/blog/drivers-and-carriers-what-keeps-you-night"&gt;annual survey&lt;/a&gt; by the American Transportation Research Institute (ATRI). Commercial drivers ranked it second in the same survey — behind the ELD Mandate, but ahead of other pressing issues such as Hours of Service, driver distraction and driver health and wellness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On one hand, it stands to reason that drivers are more focused than carriers are on parking issues. Drivers are the ones out there on the streets, fighting for spots. They’re the ones who are getting directly inconvenienced. They’re the ones who need to spend extra time scrambling to find one of a limited number of spots in a specific area to park while dropping off a delivery or logging out to comply with Hours of Service requirements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, it’s not just a driver’s problem. Lack of truck parking is affecting carriers’ bottom lines and creating situations where carriers, as well as truck drivers, will find themselves at risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let’s look at the scope of the problem itself. The American Trucking Associations (ATA) reports that there are only 300,000 parking spots for more than three million truck drivers on the roadways. While the shortage is likely to be more pronounced in certain localities based on who’s on the road and where, the 10 percent ratio of spots to rigs is bound to create issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on another ATRI study, an astounding 58 percent of all drivers admit to parking in unauthorized or undesignated spots at least three times per week. Included in that group was a subgroup of just under 10 percent that admitted to parking off the grid daily. Only 11 percent of all drivers said they never park in unauthorized or undesignated spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While some law enforcement leaders argue that drivers park illegally when they don’t have to, ATRI Vice President Dan Murray rejected the notion. &lt;a href="https://www.trucknews.com/transportation/atri-narrows-top-10-issues-trucking-industry-now-facing/1003083960/"&gt;At Omnitracs’ 2018 user conference&lt;/a&gt;, he said the group’s data showed that only 3.5 percent of all illegal parking actions could have been avoided by parking in a legal spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly, there’s an issue. If there were legal spots available, drivers would use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inability to find parking hurts drivers and carriers financially. According to ATRI research, truck drivers spend an average of one hour searching for parking every day. The lost time equates to $4,600 in lost wages per year, based on the hour lost to nonproductive trips. It also depresses fleet productivity, taking the driver out of action when he or she could be pushing ahead to the next location. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a driver is unable to find a legal parking spot, he or she is often forced into an uncomfortable situation: parking illegally, or illegally operating outside of Hours of Service (HOS) regulations. The driver may be forced to park in an unsafe area — in a poorly lit parking lot, a run-down lot in a remote area, or along the side of a highway. All present serious safety and security risks to truck drivers and other motorists. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a law enforcement officer spots an illegal parker, he can ticket the driver — which will cut into the carrier’s profits. Another option is to give the driver a break and send him down the road in search of a legal spot. But this might be compounding the problem if the driver is fatigued or operating in violation of federal HOS regulations. A little leniency can expose the driver and the carrier to an escalating series of risks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In its annual report the ATRI outlined these &lt;a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/trucking/atri-study-parking?utm_source=FreightWaves+Daily+Newsletter+Subscribers&amp;amp;utm_campaign=4d4955b0c2-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_11_02_02_01&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_6b16748ce6-4d4955b0c2-104609653"&gt;proposed strategies&lt;/a&gt; for dealing with the truck parking problem: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open up more parking spots on the National Freight Network: This includes reopening so-called “shuttered” parking areas, investing in new facilities, and repurposing vacant urban and suburban parcels for truck parking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Educate the public on the safety impacts of eliminating truck-designated parking spots and not replacing them &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional research on real-time truck parking information and reservation systems: &lt;a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/economics/solving-the-truck-parking-problem"&gt;A pilot system&lt;/a&gt; under the Mid America Association of State Transportation Officials (MAASTO) is planned for 2019&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drivers are also campaigning for more leeway in “&lt;a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/trucking/fmcsa-personal-conveyance-rule-ata?utm_source=FreightWaves+Daily+Newsletter+Subscribers&amp;amp;utm_campaign=21b5b86c0e-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_10_29_04_08&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_6b16748ce6-21b5b86c0e-104609653"&gt;personal conveyance&lt;/a&gt;” rules to help them find parking spots. Right now, the rules state that drivers can exempt their miles from daily limits to find parking but can’t use a personal conveyance to get a jump on the next day’s miles. Drivers are arguing that they should be able to head in the direction of their next day’s trip and be given more miles to find parking if spots are severely limited in a particular area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As urban areas reclaim more parking spots and more trucks make their way onto the road, the truck parking issue isn’t going away anytime soon. Drivers recognize this. Other stakeholders — carriers, governments, associations, fleet managers — all need to band together to give the problem the attention it needs. It will take a united front to come up with a solution that moves the issue further down everybody’s priority lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/blog/tags/trucking" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Trucking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item odd"&gt;&lt;a href="/blog/tags/parking" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;parking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-image-featured field-type-image field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;img typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://www.omnitracs.com/sites/default/files/styles/blog_single/public/gettyimages-92033473.jpg?itok=brgTKEvA" width="500" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>Omnitracs joins customers in honoring veterans in Wreaths Across America event</title>
    <link>https://www.omnitracs.com/blog/omnitracs-joins-customers-honoring-veterans-wreaths-across-america-event</link>
    <description>&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the ninth consecutive year, Omnitracs is honored to support Wreaths Across America (WAA) alongside customers like &lt;a href="https://www.pottlestrans.com/"&gt;Pottle’s Transportation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.crengland.com/"&gt;C.R. England&lt;/a&gt;. WAA hosts “Wreaths Across America Day” every December to remember and honor Veterans and to teach children the value of freedom. This year, Omnitracs will donate 2,500 wreaths and employees will participate in wreath-laying ceremonies at Dallas-Fort Worth National Cemetery, Arlington National Cemetery, Fort Snelling National Cemetery in Minneapolis, and Miramar National Cemetery in San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its inception, the trucking industry has been a critical part of WAA. One of the biggest in-kind donations come in the form of donated trucking to make sure all wreaths make it to the right place. Shipping costs can be pricey, so donations from trucking companies for their time and resources is what helps Wreaths Across America thrive and grow. This year, there will be 500 trucks and two million wreaths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the commitment to veterans extends beyond WAA. Omnitracs and its customers hire veterans because &lt;a href="https://www.omnitracs.com/blog/fourth-july-tribute-trucking-and-our-military"&gt;soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines&lt;/a&gt; learn how to drive, repair or support big vehicles or to manage logistics while in service — which is why so many gravitate toward a career in trucking. Veterans hold such a special place in the hearts of transportation companies as the industry employs about &lt;a href="https://www.truckersnews.com/be-part-of-our-salute-to-drivers-who-are-veterans-too/"&gt;11 percent&lt;/a&gt; of working veterans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Omnitracs’ employees and customers alike believe it’s their duty to give back and pay respect to veterans and their families, especially during the holiday season, and one of the best ways to do this is supporting the Wreaths Across America program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="media media-element-container media-default"&gt;&lt;img title="Omnitracs Wreaths Across America" style="height: 267px; width: 400px;" class="media-element file-default" data-delta="1" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://www.omnitracs.com/sites/default/files/omnitracsemployeeswaa2017.jpg" width="1024" height="683" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barry Pottle, president and CEO of &lt;a href="https://www.pottlestrans.com/"&gt;Pottle's Transportation&lt;/a&gt;, has been involved with WAA since the start.  During his first year delivering wreaths, he drove past a woman with her hand on her heart. She was crying and mouthing the words ‘thank you’ to the passing trucks. In that moment, Barry realized how much this event meant to the families and communities of these fallen heroes. Over the years, he’s worked with organizations like the Truckload Carriers Associations, the American Trucking Associations, and other state organizations to help coordinate wreath deliveries. This year, Barry and his team will once again deliver wreaths to Arlington Cemetery alongside many Omnitracs volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="media media-element-container media-default"&gt;&lt;img style="height: 275px; width: 400px;" class="media-element file-default" data-delta="2" alt="" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://www.omnitracs.com/sites/default/files/pottles_0.jpg" width="987" height="678" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the years, Wreaths Across America has relied on the trucking industry to make this ceremony a success. As a company, Omnitracs takes this opportunity to reflect and give thanks to fallen veterans for their service and courage. They’re the ones who have sacrificed to make sure that our homes, roads, and loved ones are safe.

    <title>Ask our experts: What we’ve learned in the first year of the ELD Mandate</title>
    <link>https://www.omnitracs.com/blog/ask-our-experts-what-weve-learned-first-year-eld-mandate</link>
    <description>&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the one-year anniversary of the U.S.’s Electronic Logging Device (ELD) Mandate falling on Dec. 18, 2018, trucking companies are either looking back at the rule’s impact or looking ahead to ensure that their temporarily exempt devices are ELD-certified by December of 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get some perspective on the ELD law heading into year two, we checked in with Omnitracs Vice President of Regulatory Affairs Tom Cuthbertson to hear his views.       &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How smooth has the adoption been?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adoption is happening, but it’s been a marathon, not a sprint. Fleets that put in &lt;a href="https://www.omnitracs.com/blog/cvsas-annual-inspection-blitz-will-your-fleet-pass-hours-service-test"&gt;AOBRDs (Automatic On-Board Recording Devices)&lt;/a&gt; before the compliance date are very slow to migrate over to ELDs. The majority of them are still running AOBRDs. We’re counseling people to plan their migrations ahead of time. We went from a three-page regulation to a 120-page technical spec, which can be understandably daunting but shouldn’t delay the migration process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a significant number of companies that haven’t changed over?&lt;br /&gt;Yes, there are. I think you’ll start to see people migrate over right after the first of the year because they know they’ll only have 12 months left at that point. Freight is seasonal. When we get through the holidays into January and February, you’ll see more companies shifting over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the biggest impact of the rule?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it’s the learning curve of going from paper to an electronic device. People talk about productivity – that they could lose four to five percent implementing ELDs. That may be true in the beginning when you’re learning these things. However, I’ve heard from many other carriers that they’re picking up at least that amount of productivity because of better planning, better understanding of the availability of hours per load, and better load assignments for drivers. When I talk to a driver after they’ve used ELDs for a period of time, the feedback is always the same — they don’t want to drive without them. They’re happy they have them and they feel like their &lt;a href="https://fleet.omnitracs.com/achieving-fleet-productivity-goals-electronic-logging-devices.html"&gt;productivity goals are being met&lt;/a&gt;. Some drivers feel they’re getting drive time back because it’s minute to minute versus the 15-minute increments on the paper. With the ELDs, you know the driving time availability and the duty time availability, which is extremely beneficial.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are carriers getting the benefits they were expecting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carriers that adopted AOBRDs a while ago may not be seeing a difference of getting information from fuel management and having better dispatch because they’re getting similar information from what they had before. However, there are a lot of owner/operators that can take better advantage of it. Small fleets can take advantage of having a device hooked to the engine. This allows them to see if they’re having engine faults that can degrade the engine or have a costly repair like an engine rebuild. If they can prevent service failures on their loads, they can prevent costly maintenance and better manage their fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has enforcement at roadside?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While training for enforcement started in 2017, carriers were not fully ready for what drivers had to communicate at roadside. There was confusion between drivers and enforcement about whether they had an ELD or an AOBRD. As long as a driver installed an AOBRD before the compliance date in 2017, they could use that AOBRD for two years. This means that there are devices that were registered that one could run as an AOBRD but a lot of inspection violations were being handed out due to communication issues between enforcement and the driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The associations and Omnitracs have done quite a bit of communication reminding drivers what they have to say to enforcement at roadside. People for a long time were just indiscriminately thinking ‘I have an ELD.’ It may be registered, but you’re still running AOBRD software. There was a significant amount of confusion out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the confusion starting to subside?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, but there’s still a lot of confusion out there. After December 2017, you had to have an AOBRD or an ELD. They weren’t doing hard enforcement, but they were still handing out inspection violations for not having a device and didn’t count against CSA. When April 1 came around, they were allowed to put them out of service if drivers didn’t have an AOBRD or an ELD in the vehicle. And in April there were probably between 1,200 to 1,300 inspection violations handed out for no AOBRD or ELD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s one positive piece of news. Form and Manner violations — essentially not filling out the right information — dropped like a rock with ELDs. Out-of-Service violations also went way down. When a vehicle is put out of service, it’s put out of service for 10 hours. That’s created a significant incentive for companies to comply. Because all the electronic data has been recorded with an ELD, those type of violations have taken a significant drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kinds of changes will we see in year two?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t think we’ll really see many changes. The biggest impact will be the adoption of ELDs by people that have lagged behind and the training they’ll undergo to move over to ELDs. They’ll become more aware of new rules — like now drive starts at 5 mph. Somebody may have moved the truck to refuel at the end of the night, and hasn’t logged in. If it goes at 5 mph, it’s another unassigned drive. When you don’t have a login, there’s a whole administrative process that has to go through. As people adopt and adjust, they’re going to have to put in new processes and training. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall, has the ELD Mandate been a positive move?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think so. I’m speaking as a vendor, but it’s clear that everybody’s on the same page. Everybody’s thinking the same way. You’re supposed to be certified — you’re supposed to be following the rules. If they tighten the rules up and people are following the certification properly, it’s better for the drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Drivers and carriers: What keeps you up at night?</title>
    <link>https://www.omnitracs.com/blog/drivers-and-carriers-what-keeps-you-night</link>
    <description>&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heading into the new year, what are the biggest issues on the minds of truck drivers and carriers? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The American Transportation Research Institute recently released the results of its &lt;a href="http://atri-online.org/2018/10/29/critical-issues-in-the-trucking-industry-2018/"&gt;annual survey&lt;/a&gt;, and, to no one’s surprise, driver shortages, driver retention, and Hours of Service requirements gravitated to the top of the list. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each of the three issues has been front and center for several years now. Driver shortages put huge amounts of pressure on carriers, forcing them to scramble to keep routes covered. Driver retention, of course, is a strategy to deal with driver shortages, underscoring the importance of staffing on industry executives’ agendas. Hours of Service rules? Carriers are doing their best to manage the mandate and drivers are adapting to the changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we had to bet, these three issues will probably be big sources of discussion next year, the year after, and the year after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, some of the other issues that made the list could move up a few rungs next year. ATRI’s combined survey of drivers and carriers ranked the following issues in order, four through ten: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Electronic Logging Device (ELD) Mandate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Truck parking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compliance, safety and accountability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Driver distraction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transportation infrastructure/traffic congestion/funding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Driver health and wellness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one would expect, truck drivers and carriers delivered different responses, reflecting their different priorities. While Hours of Service topped drivers’ list, carriers ranked it third behind driver shortage and driver retention. Driver shortage (#9) and driver retention (#5) were lower priorities for the drivers themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These placements make sense. While Hours of Service affects both sides of the house, it gnaws at some drivers because they feel it’s taking away flexibility. &lt;a href="https://www.omnitracs.com/blog/fmcsa-solicits-public-comments-hours-service-regulations"&gt;Potential changes&lt;/a&gt; that are currently being debated — expanding the daily, on-duty exemption for short-haul drivers from 12 to 14 hours, relaxing time constraints in bad-weather conditions — would give drivers a little more flexibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, driver shortage and driver retention are bigger issues for carriers because they’re the ones charged with solving the problems. The drivers themselves want to be paid better and want better work environments, but, based on the survey, they’re more concerned with other issues like driver distraction (#4 on their list), compliance, safety, and accountability (#6), and driver health and wellness (#7).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The driver shortage is real — no doubt about it. Industry experts expect &lt;a href="https://www.omnitracs.com/blog/what-can-be-done-about-canadian-truckings-driver-shortage"&gt;the shortfall&lt;/a&gt; to reach 160,000 in the U.S. by 2022 and 34,000 in Canada by 2024. Carriers have put it at the top of their list, and they’re &lt;a href="https://www.omnitracs.com/blog/trucking-industry-working-improve-all-aspects-driving-experience"&gt;trying to do something about it&lt;/a&gt;. The ELD Mandate is opening up discussions about one of drivers’ biggest frustrations: transitioning the pay system from by-the-mile to hourly. They’re equipping vehicles with infotainment systems, cushier sleeper cabs, and driver-focused technologies (like souped-up dashboards, rear- or side-facing cameras). New communications technologies also are keeping drivers better informed and more closely connected to the rest of the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driver distraction is a &lt;a href="https://www.fleetowner.com/safety/catching-fatigue-and-distractions-they-happen"&gt;big issue with drivers&lt;/a&gt;. The National Center for Statistics and Analysis found more than 10 percent of fatal crashes and 15 percent of injury crashes are related to distracted driving. While the problem won’t go away overnight, technology advancements can help. Omnitracs developed a predictive model that incorporates hours-of-service (HOS) data to help determine if a driver could be at risk of a fatigue event. There are other systems that detect eye movements such as drooping eyelids and triggers steps such as an audible alarm and vibration of the driver’s seat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The transportation infrastructure category placed eighth on the drivers’ list and fourth on the carriers.’ Based on the amount of times the issue came up at the ATA’s annual conference, ATRI President Rebecca Brewster said she thought the condition of the nation’s roads and bridges would have ranked higher on the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everybody has their opinion but one thing’s for sure: All of these issues will bubble up often in 2019, and a few other concerns will make their way down the highway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What issue in the trucking industry keeps you up at night?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/blog/tags/trucking" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Trucking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item odd"&gt;&lt;a href="/blog/tags/drivers" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Drivers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-image-featured field-type-image field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;img typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://www.omnitracs.com/sites/default/files/styles/blog_single/public/gettyimages-869313402.jpg?itok=iXMGwTCV" width="500" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
