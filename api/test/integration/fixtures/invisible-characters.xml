				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>PHILADELPHIA, PA July 2015</strong>—They are treasures that have survived centuries and even millennia: one of the world’s oldest fragments of the gospel of Saint Matthew; the first Bible printed in the Americas, in the Native American language of Massachuset; a New Testament Bible published in twelve languages in Nuremberg, Germany, 1599; the earliest version of the Mesopotamian flood story, pre-dating the Biblical story of Noah, written on clay nearly 2,500 years ago.</p>
<p>In honor of the first visit by Pope Francis and the World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia, the Penn Museum, in conjunction with the Penn Libraries, offers <strong><em>Sacred Writings: Extraordinary Texts of the Biblical World</em></strong>, a special exhibition of rare artifacts from the Museum Collection and rare books and manuscripts from the Penn Libraries. On view August 15 through November 7, <strong><em>Sacred Writings</em></strong> provides the centerpiece experience for a Museum visit, where a special focus on the ancient Near East, Egypt, and the Canaan and Ancient Israel galleries and beyond affords visitors a unique opportunity to delve into ancient cultures and Bible-era art and artifacts.</p>
<p>Ten texts are featured in<strong> <em>Sacred Writings: Extraordinary Texts of the Biblical World</em></strong>:</p>
<p><em><u>Treasures from the Penn Museum:</u></em></p>
<p><strong>One of the world’s oldest fragments of the gospel of Saint Matthew</strong>, written on papyrus and dating to the 3rd century CE, was once part of a codex (book). This fragment, written in ancient Greek, contains the beginning of the Gospel of Matthew (Chapter 1: 1-9 and 12-20), a section that details the lineage of Jesus. (This is one of two genealogies of Jesus provided in the New Testament; the Gospel of Luke offers a largely different genealogy).</p>
<p>An ancient clay tablet in Sumerian cuneiform from the site of Nippur in Mesopotamia (now in Iraq), circa 1650 BCE, contains <strong>the earliest version of the Mesopotamian flood story</strong>.  This tale becomes part of the Epic of Gilgamesh, and tells of a flood that destroyed humankind—the story closely parallels the biblical story of Noah.</p>
<p>A richly decorated, illuminated <strong>Qur’an </strong>from Iran, believed to have been made in Cairo in 1164, is written in Naskhi (early Arabic script), and features the complete text of the Qur’an in black script, with commentary in red script.</p>
<p><em><u>Treasures from the Penn Libraries’ Collections:</u></em></p>
<p>An illuminated <strong>Latin Bible produced in Arras, France</strong> in the late 13<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>The <strong>first authorized Roman Catholic translation of the New Testament Bible</strong> into English, printed at Reims, France, through the efforts of English Catholic exiles, in 1582.</p>
<p>The <strong>first complete Bible printed in the New World</strong>, a monumental translation of the Bible into the Native American Massachuset language, by Puritan missionary John Eliot, in 1663.</p>
<p>A <strong>polyglot New Testament Bible</strong> compiled by German scholar Elias Hutter with side by side text in twelve languages—Syriac, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, German, Czech, Italian, Spanish, French, English, Danish, and Polish—printed in Nuremberg in 1599.</p>
<p>A late 15<sup>th</sup> century Italian illustrated manuscript copy of Werner Rolevinck’s <strong>history of the world from the creation to the election of Pope Sixtus IV</strong>.</p>
<p>An <strong>early 16<sup>th</sup> century Rabbinic Bible</strong> from the famed Hebrew printing house of Daniel Bomberg in Venice, Italy.</p>
<p>A <strong>limited edition contemporary Bible</strong> from the Pennyroyal Caxton Press, 1999, designed and illustrated by Barry Moser.</p>
<p>Bringing together scholars from diverse areas at the University of Pennsylvania, <strong><em>Sacred Writings: Extraordinary Texts of the Biblical World</em></strong> is co-curated by Dr. Mitch Fraas, Curator, Special Collections, the Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts, University of Pennsylvania Libraries; Dr. Renata Holod, Curator, Near East Section; Dr. Phillip Jones, Associate Curator and Keeper, Near East Section, Penn Museum; Dr. Steve Tinney, Associate Curator-in-Charge, Near East Section, Penn Museum; and Dr. Jennifer Wegner, Associate Curator, Egyptian Section, Penn Museum.</p>
<p><strong>Bible Era and Bible Region Galleries</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the special exhibition, visitors interested in the biblical era and region can step back in time to explore rare art, artifacts and large-scale photographs in several galleries: the Museum’s renowned <strong><em>Egypt (Sphinx)</em></strong> gallery and a side gallery, <strong><em>Amarna, Ancient Egypt’s Place in the Sun</em></strong>; <strong><em>Iraq’s Ancient Past: Rediscovering Ur’s Royal Cemetery</em></strong>; <strong><em>Canaan and Ancient Israel</em></strong>; and <strong><em>Sacred Spaces: The Photography of Ahmet Ertug</em></strong>, featuring spectacular large-scale photographs of Byzantine-era churches in Constantinople (Istanbul) and the Cappadocia region of Turkey.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of the Penn Libraries&#8217; efforts to support the dissemination of Penn scholarship and to support innovative and sustainable open-access projects, we have set up an institutional plan with PeerJ (a publishing platform focusing on biology, medicine, and general science) and PeerJ Computer Science, <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://peerj.com/institutions/38/university-of-pennsylvania/">https://peerj.com/institutions/38/university-of-pennsylvania/</a>. PeerJ has developed a model of lifetime memberships for its authors. Through the libraries&#8217; institutional plan, Penn faculty and students who are accepted through peer review for publication with PeerJ will automatically receive a basic lifetime membership, which will allow them to post unlimited preprints and to publish one peer-reviewed article a year with PeerJ or PeerJ Computer Science.</p>
<p>PeerJ is one of a number of open access initiatives currently funded through the collections budget. Those initiatives include subscriptions to BioMed Central (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/">http://www.biomedcentral.com/</a>), a large open access journal platform, arXiv (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://arxiv.org/">http://arxiv.org/</a>), the long established physics preprint database, and Scoap3 (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://scoap3.org/">http://scoap3.org/</a>), a partnership of libraries and funding agents to convert high energy physics journals to open access. The libraries are also supporting initiatives such as Knowledge Unlatched (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://collections.knowledgeunlatched.org/collection-availability-1/">http://collections.knowledgeunlatched.org/collection-availability-1/</a>), which forms library and publisher partnerships to support open access publication of books on specialized topics, Open Library of the Humanities (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://www.openlibhums.org/">https://www.openlibhums.org/</a>), which is creating an open access mega journal and supporting the publication of open access scholarly books, and finally the Open Access Network (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://openaccessnetwork.org/">http://openaccessnetwork.org</a>), which seeks to develop a new model of centralized funding for open access.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=pennlibnews.wordpress.com&#038;blog=64884502&#038;post=3030&#038;subd=pennlibnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>PHILADELPHIA, PA, July 6<sup>th</sup>, 2015 </strong>&#8211; Thanks to the generosity of alumnus Jeff Seltzer (W’78) and his wife Annie, the University of Pennsylvania Libraries is proud to announce the eight winners of the 2015 Seltzer Family Digital Media Awards: Alicia Chon (W ’16), DeDe DeDe (LPS ’16), Carolina English (C ’16), Taylor Evensen (C ’16), Antoni Gierczak (C ’16), Justin Kagotho (HISB, C ’18, W ’18), Christopher Kao (ENG ’18), and Eileen Wang (C ’16). The annual Seltzer Awards recognize and support creative use of new media technologies by Penn undergraduate students for academic research projects. Each student will have exclusive use of approximately $1,000 of technology for one year to purchase equipment such as video cameras, still cameras, and audio recorders.</p>
<p>This is the eighth year that the Seltzer Family Digital Media Awards have supported student projects. The awards are managed by the Penn Libraries in collaboration with the Center for Undergraduate Research and Fellowships (CURF).</p>
<p>Below are details about this year’s eight funded projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alicia Chon</strong> (W’16) will further the exploration of beauty she started building on her website, <em>The Raw Book</em> in the context of her Korean heritage. She plans to explore a project featuring portraits of people she encounters and their answer to the simple question: “What is beauty?” Alicia will use a digital camera to capture these portraits as she travels to at least five countries in the coming year.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Under the guidance of Assistant Professor of History, Dr. Tamara Walker, <strong>DeDe DeDe</strong> (C’16) will conduct research for his honors history thesis on the invention of the steel drum. DeDe will use audio and visual sources in the form of oral history and tradition, musical recordings, and videos of Trinidad and Tobago’s world famous carnival. DeDe explains his decision to present his research as a documentary, saying “a multimedia format…seems to be the most appropriate method of presenting research on the steel drum which is about movement and sound and the active creation of culture.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carolina English </strong>(C’16), under the guidance of Dr. Gary Hatfield, Seybert Professor of Philosophy and Director of the Visual Studies department, will be experimenting with an installation that recreates the experiences of a woman named Dee Fletcher chronicled in Melvin Goodale and David Milner&#8217;s award-winning book, <em>Sight Unseen</em>. After an unfortunate accident, Dee Fletcher suffered damage to her brain’s ventral stream. She was unable to identify obstacles in front of her, but was still able to move out of the obstacle’s way without intervention. Carolina will attempt to recreate this experience by installing an “imaginary” obstacle course that the brain perceives as real. This installation would amplify the ventral stream’s action of identification, making the viewer more aware of its processing and more empathetic to people without it. She will create a short documentary that will highlight her procedures, shortcomings, and ultimate outcome with the hope that it will produce a more tangible and relatable project.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Working under the direction of Walter H. Annenberg Professor of History, Dr. Walter Licht, <strong>Taylor Evensen </strong>(C &#8217;16) will use an audio recorder and video camera to interview Cuban exiles in Miami for her thesis research. This project will provide clarity to the history of American-Cuban relations by analyzing the property expropriations of the United Fruit Company, Francisco Sugar Company, and Manatí Sugar Company. Through her work, Evensen aims to provide a more inclusive picture of the 1959 Cuban Revolution and its far-reaching effects.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Antoni Gierczak</strong> (C’16), under the guidance of Richard Wesley, Undergraduate Chair and Adjunct Professor of Architecture in PennDesign, will create an interactive media installation in a corridor on campus. A server will check Facebook and Twitter for a user’s particular hashtag and interpret the bundled information using infrared sensors and the server. This information will then be processed by an Arduino system, which will produce color blocking and images pulled from Google within the installation. Gierczak’s goal is to revitalize the corridor by offering an attractive circulatory alternative and allowing the user to interact with, decipher, and create content within the system in a way that blurs the strict spatial divisions between human and architecture.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Justin Kagotho</strong> (HISB, C’18, W’18) will be working under the direction of Dr. Sara Byala, Senior Lecturer at the Center for Programs in Contemporary Writing, in conducting research about Coca-Cola&#8217;s influence in Africa. To conduct this research, Kathogo will visit Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Cameroon. This research will entail such activities as conducting oral interviews with locals, officials working in the Coca-Cola factories, as well as the retailers selling the product. During his time in Africa, Kathogo will visit Coca-Cola bottling factories, clean water facilities, and explore other Coca-Cola initiatives.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As an undergraduate fellow of Penn CAMRA (a new student organization promoting the use of new media for documenting research results) and working with advisor Mariam Durrani, <strong>Christopher Kao</strong> (ENG’18) will continue to explore new ways of conveying information through autostereographic video software he has created using Xbox Kinect. Autostereographic video is a breakthrough technology that allows viewers to see 3D images on a normal screen, without the need of any special glasses.</li>
</ul>

<li>Under the guidance of Edmund J. and Louise W. Kahn, Term Professor in Anthropology, Dr. Adriana Petryna, <strong>Eileen Wang </strong>(C’16) will be studying the sociocultural context of cesarean deliveries on maternal request for them in Shanghai, China. As part of the ethnographic research for her Health and Societies thesis, she will be using a Zoom audio recorder to capture interviews with doctors, nurses, pregnant women, new mothers, and family members at a district hospital on the topic of birth and delivery. With this data, she hopes to understand how these various factors interact in shaping how Chinese mothers give birth and how they fit into the larger picture of the rising rates of cesarean sections in the country.</li>

<p>The Penn Alerts Table of Delivery Service has been phased out. Over the years, notification services have evolved to help researchers stay current with journal literature and to customize the kinds of alerts that interest them. Nearly a decade ago, Penn Alerts was an early entry into this field of technologies.</p>
<p>But in recent years, as faculty and students have adopted easier and more customizable current awareness tools, many of them available at no cost through other services licensed by the Penn Libraries, the use of Penn Alerts has greatly declined. With these more sophisticated tools at hand, and user interest shifting dramatically in new directions, we now see the need to retire this service.</p>
<p>In an effort to assist you in converting to more current alternatives, we have created this site, <a href="http://guides.library.upenn.edu/alerts" target="_blank">guides.library.upenn.edu/alerts</a>, with links to resources that allow for table of contents, topical, author, and citing article alerts. In addition, <a href="http://gethelp.library.upenn.edu/contact/subjspec/" target="_blank">your school or departmental library liaison</a> can work with you directly to evaluate your needs and set up an alternative notification service.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience and flexibility during this transition.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=pennlibnews.wordpress.com&#038;blog=64884502&#038;post=2914&#038;subd=pennlibnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="western"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">This summer, the Penn Libraries will begin the construction of the last phase of the Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts. The construction project will take place on the fifth floor of Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center. The project will provide two structural benefits to the Libraries and the Penn community: a secure, climate-controlled space for rare books and manuscripts as well as Penn’s first and only </span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">book and </span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">paper conservation lab to treat and repair library materials, ensuring that they will be preserved for generations of scholars. The new collections space will house thousands of volumes in a temperature and humidity-controlled environment and allow us to keep an array of special collections material on-site and readily available for researchers.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">In preparation for the construction, work needs to be done to the heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems that run along a portion of the ceiling on the fifth floor. To allow access to the ceiling, books in stack ranges </span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:small;"><b>C</b></span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:small;"> (</span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:small;"><i>Auxiliary Sciences of History</i></span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">) and a portion of </span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:small;"><b>D</b></span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:small;"> (</span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:small;"><i>World History</i></span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">) will be temporarily relocated to a compact shelving area within Van Pelt Library.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">We have taken every measure to limit the disruption of the use of these items. Beginning in July and ending in the late fall, books from the previously mentioned ranges will have to be requested for delivery through </span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:small;"><b>Faculty Express </b></span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">or for pickup at the </span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:small;"><b>Van Pelt Circulation Desk</b></span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">. Both of these services are accessible through Franklin (</span></span></span><a href="http://www.franklin.library.upenn.edu/"><span style="color:#1155cc;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:small;"><u>http://franklin.library.upenn.edu</u></span></span></span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">), found on the Penn Libraries homepage.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">The Kislak Center Reading Room will remain open during all phases of the construction project. Patrons are asked to please request materials in advance to ensure they are retrieved and available.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

<p><a href="https://pennlibnews.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/catrice.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-2880 alignleft" src="https://pennlibnews.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/catrice.jpg?w=183&#038;h=300" alt="Catrice" width="183" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>On Monday, June 16, I had the privilege of delivering the commencement address to the graduating class of <a href="http://webgui.phila.k12.pa.us/schools/k/kensingtonbusiness">Kensington International Business High School (KIBHS)</a>.  The honor of speaking to such a promising group of young students is one that I owe to <a href="http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/staff/record.html?q=matt&amp;view=internal&amp;id=663&amp;">Matt Pilecki</a> of the Penn Libraries, who extended the initial invitation. Jon Jacobs of <a href="http://www.academiesinc.org/">Philadelphia Academies, Inc.</a>reached out to Matt in April about potential speakers at Penn. Matt and Jon have collaborated on several outreach initiatives in the past, including a business clothing drive at Penn Law that resulted in the collection of over 1,000 articles of clothing for high school students entering the workforce <span class="s1">or pursuing higher education.</span></p>
<p>KIBHS serves students from Latino and African American backgrounds, many of whom face tremendous challenges in the pursuit of an education. These are challenges that I certainly understand as a Black first-generation college student.  Building on the commitment to community outreach established by <a href="http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/staff/record.html?q=ancil&amp;view=internal&amp;id=89&amp;">Ancil George </a>and Penn Libraries’ <a href="http://guides.library.upenn.edu/content.php?pid=602704">Group on Library Diversity (GOLD)</a>, I decided to use this opportunity to share the tests and trials I faced during my own educational journey.  My goal was to inspire hope in the graduates, to let them know that despite their challenges, if they press on, a testimony awaits them on the other side of victory. The graduates, parents and staff received the message with warmth and gratitude, a gift that I will cherish always.</p>
<p>Penn Libraries and the GOLD group proudly salute the graduating class of 2015. May your future be bright and prosperous!</p><img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=pennlibnews.wordpress.com&#038;blog=64884502&#038;post=2879&#038;subd=pennlibnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The following press release was provided to the Penn Libraries by Scholarly Communications Librarian Shawn Martin.</em></p>
<p><strong>PHILADELPHIA, PA  </strong>The University of Pennsylvania, Thomas Jefferson University, and West Chester University are pleased to announce the launch of Pennsylvania Research Commons. The Commons is a new digital portal that showcases research and academic scholarship conducted in Pennsylvania, from undergraduate journals to faculty monographs, and makes this work openly accessible to scholars around the world. The new digital portal site features a real-time global readership map, highlighting the international reach and significance of research from Pennsylvania institutions.</p>
<p>“Global impact is one of the cornerstones of our strategic plan, and portals like the Pennsylvania Research Commons help to expand and measure the reach of Penn scholarship around the world,” says Shawn Martin, the Scholarly Communication Librarian at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Curated by university librarians and their supporting institutions and hosted by bepress on its Digital Commons platform, the Pennsylvania Research Commons aggregates content from the institutional repositories of nineteen Pennsylvania institutions. Institutional repositories are playing an increasingly significant role in the way universities share, manage, and preserve their scholarly outputs.</p>
<p>Walter Cressler, the Science Librarian and Repository Administrator at West Chester University, states, “The Pennsylvania Research Commons enhances the impact of the state’s institutional repositories by providing a platform for regional scholarly and creative collaboration and a showcase that highlights some of the unique resources of Pennsylvania.”</p>
<p>The Commons includes a growing collection of peer-reviewed journal articles, book chapters, dissertations, working papers, conference proceedings, and other original scholarly work. Users can type in search terms for easy discovery or browse content by institution, discipline, or author.</p>
<p>The Commons also showcases unique collections and notable archives of regional interest and local history, providing primary materials for research about the Keystone State. Daniel Kipnis, Senior Education Librarian and Editor of the Jefferson Digital Commons at Thomas Jefferson University, notes: “The Pennsylvania Research Commons (PRC) is a great online portal to share high quality research being conducted in the Keystone State.  Along with capturing conferences on various topics, the PRC also highlights oral histories and other special collections for a global audience. Thomas Jefferson University is pleased to contribute to this valuable portal.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>PHILADELPHIA, PA</strong><strong>, June 16, 2014—</strong> A century after its appearance, T.S. Eliot’s “The Love Song of J. <a href="https://pennlibnews.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/welsch.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-2867 alignright" src="https://pennlibnews.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/welsch.jpg?w=300&#038;h=286" alt="Welsch" width="300" height="286" /></a>Alfred Prufrock continues to inspire new presentations of the work across many different artistic genres. In the spirit of joining that inspired chorus, the Penn Libraries are happy to announce their June 2015 exhibition “Let Us Go Then, You and I: Celebrating the 100<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the Publication of T.S. Eliot’s ‘The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.’” The free, public exhibition features selections from the Carol and Erwin Welsch T.S. Eliot Collection and is located on the sixth floor of Van-Pelt Dietrich Library Center, next to the Class of 1978 Pavilion.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Carol and Erwin (FA’58) Welsch shared a life-long passion for Eliot’s verse, meticulously assembling the entire body of published work of one of the greatest poets of the twentieth century. According to Director of the Rare Book and Manuscript Library, David McKnight, Erwin’s interest in Eliot began in a Modern poetry course he took at Penn. Erwin was enthralled by Eliot’s “rhythmic, jarring-yet-masterful poetry.” The Welsches spent fifty years amassing this collection, a challenging and expensive pursuit that produced a precious gift for the Penn Libraries.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Notable items in the Welsch Collection include:</p>
<ul style="text-align:left;">
<li>Lytton Strachey’s copy of <em>Prufrock and other Observations</em></li>
<li>Eliot’s fourth book <em>Ara Vos Pres</em> (An edition that once belonged to Eliot’s brother, Henry Ware Eliot and bears the signature of the American poet, Yvor Winters)</li>
<li>Publisher and editor of <em>Poetry and Drama</em> Harold Munro’s annotated copy of Eliot’s <em>Poems 1909-1925</em></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="https://pennlibnews.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/prufrock-feat.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-2866 aligncenter" src="https://pennlibnews.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/prufrock-feat.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Prufrock Feat" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Beyond the important achievement of collecting Eliot firsts, Carol and Erwin expanded the scope of their Eliot collection to include enough ephemera and secondary sources to delight both the serious scholar and casual observer.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Members of the Penn community can access the Welsch collection at the Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center in the Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books, and Manuscripts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the week of June 22nd, the Libraries will introduce a new, expanded Franklin interface called <em>Franklin:Discovery</em>!  <em>Franklin:Discovery</em> will provide access to the resources you expect to find in the familiar Franklin catalog, but will also allow you to search for and retrieve the full text of articles published in scholarly journal articles, magazines, newspapers, and other types of content, all in a single interface.</p>
<p>You can combine your <strong>Catalog &amp; Articles+</strong> results on a single page. Or click on a tab to search just <strong>Catalog</strong> or <strong>Articles+</strong>. These options are explained in greater detail below.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_2791" style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://pennlibnews.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/franklin-meta-tab.png"><img class="wp-image-2791 size-large" src="https://pennlibnews.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/franklin-meta-tab.png?w=610&#038;h=437" alt="Franklin: Catalog &amp; Articles+ tab" width="610" height="437" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Franklin: Catalog &amp; Articles+ is the default search.</p></div>
