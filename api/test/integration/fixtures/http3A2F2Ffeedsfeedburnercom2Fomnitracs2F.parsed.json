Industry leaders across the transportation and logistics community will be joining us to talk about compliance, next-gen technology, last-mile innovation, and the Omnitracs product roadmap.</p>\r\n<p>We’ve assembled several breakout sessions and a diverse panel of keynote speakers to share their industry knowledge.  Among them are Raymond P. Martinez, the sixth Administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), Dan Baker, a nationally known speaker, teacher, and consultant to the trucking industry, and Kylla Lanier, the deputy director and co-founder of Truckers Against Trafficking.</p>\r\n<p>Whether you’re attending in-person or following along on social media, here are some of the themes you can look forward to this year:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Preparing for last-mile delivery pressures</strong></p>\r\n<p>Offering superior last-mile delivery options continues to be a hot topic for Outlook attendees and this year is no different. Consumer demand for immediate and efficient delivery is putting immense pressure on transportation and logistics companies. In fact, a <a href=\"https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Report-Digital-%E2%80%93-Last-Mile-Delivery-Challenge1.pdf\">recent survey from Capgemini Research Institute</a> found that over half of consumers would switch to a competitor offering faster service. At Outlook, attendees will learn about the latest in last-mile innovations — from drones to cargo bikes — and hear ideas about utilizing same-day management tools. You’ll have the opportunity to speak with our product team and customers about how to most effectively use your routing and dispatching solutions to stay ahead of the last-mile delivery race.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Making the most of your data</strong></p>\r\n<p>Data has become a major differentiator in performance and strategic business decisions for many fleets. But with more data available than ever before, prioritizing what matters for your company can seem impossible. This year, we’ve prepared several sessions on how companies can more effectively leverage their data across a variety of our solutions. You’ll also have the chance to demo our new application, Omnitracs Reporting &amp; Analytics, and speak with some of our beta customers that are using this product. You will leave this conference with a plethora of new information on how to keep costs down, retain drivers, and improve overall operations for your business.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Staying ahead of the compliance game</strong></p>\r\n<p>Now that we are a year in on the U.S. ELD Mandate and preparing for the upcoming Canadian Mandate, compliance is top of mind for many of our Outlook attendees. Many fleets are still using Automatic On-Board Recording Devices (AOBRDs) or other technology that will need to be updated by the end of this year if they want to remain compliant. But don’t panic — we’ve brought in our top compliance experts and customers to help companies prepare for these regulatory changes and any necessary migrations to support them.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Getting your Omnitracs update for 2019 and beyond  </strong></p>\r\n<p>Last year, we announced <a href=\"https://www.omnitracs.com/company/press/omnitracs-announces-unified-fleet-management-platform-omnitracs-one\">Omnitracs One</a>, a game-changing, unified fleet management solution to improve operations from the first mile to the last. Outlook attendees will have a chance to preview the customer portal and hardware before it’s available to the public later this year. You’ll also have a chance to hear about our <a href=\"https://www.omnitracs.com/company/press/omnitracs-builds-amazon-alexa-skill-ps-transportation\">exciting innovations in voice technology assistants</a> and how these new capabilities are transforming communication for transportation and logistics companies. In addition to product updates, we will also discuss some larger technology trends like blockchain and their impact on the industry.</p>\r\n<p>During Outlook, attendees will have multiple opportunities for hands-on training and customer Q&amp;As across our solutions portfolio. Our <a href=\"https://www.omnitracs.com/blog/visible-invisible-threats-how-trucking-industry-navigating-cybersecurity-landscape\">Chief Security Officer Sharon Reynolds</a> will also give attendees an update on the security landscape and identify ways for companies to build up their defense against potential vulnerabilities. <a href=\"https://www.womenintrucking.org/\">Women in Trucking’s CEO Ellen Voie</a> will also share her take on continuing to bridge the gender gap in the transportation industry.</p>\r\n<p>For more information on the various breakout sessions, view our <a href=\"http://www.cvent.com/events/omnitracs-outlook-2019/agenda-a06d71ea11594f8cbdceaae646b7fefe.aspx\">Outlook 2019 agenda</a>.</p>\r\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-image-featured field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.omnitracs.com/sites/default/files/styles/blog_single/public/omnitracs_outlook_2019_logo_blog_featured_image.jpg?itok=OfD4_wL1\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" /></div></div></div>",

          "content": "<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"><p>Everywhere you look, you can see the effects mobile technologies have on our lives. According to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/world-population-mobile-devices-2017-9\">Business Insider</a>, two-thirds of the world’s population regularly uses mobile devices to communicate, play games, and pursue a variety of hobbies. Additionally, more and more companies are allowing their employees to be mobile-based. By 2023, experts project that nearly <a href=\"https://www.strategyanalytics.com/access-services/enterprise/mobile-workforce/market-data/report-detail/global-mobile-workforce-forecast-update-2017-2023\">half of the U.S. population</a> will be taking advantage of advanced technologies to work outside of an office — and virtually anywhere.</p>\r\n<p>Mobile innovations are impacting the trucking industry, as well. Drivers have long used cell phones for basic needs such as staying in touch with family during long drives or finding the best pizza shop on a route. But in recent years, fleet management apps have gotten smarter and more powerful, helping trucking companies become more productive, customer friendly, and responsive to their staff.</p>\r\n<p>Let’s take a closer look at how fleet managers are using mobile applications to improve their business processes in four key areas:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Operational efficiency </strong></p>\r\n<p>Understanding the behaviors and inefficiencies that increase organizational costs and weaken productivity has been a constant struggle for transportation managers. Utilizing typical back-end systems to execute tasks — like plotting out optimal routes for drivers to follow — provides minimal certainty that routes are being executed according to plan. Without access to advanced technology, managers calculate costs per mile and costs per stop by hand, without knowing whether drivers veered off of their routes to hit a favorite lunch spot or visit a friend a few towns over.</p>\r\n<p>Tools such as <a href=\"https://www.omnitracs.com/products/omnitracs-routing-dispatching-compliance\">Omnitracs’</a> <a href=\"https://www.omnitracs.com/products/omnitracs-routing-dispatching-compliance\">mobile dispatching</a> can help improve operational efficiency by allowing drivers to input data from the road and managers to track actual routes against prepared plans, monitoring costs and driver behavior.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Customer satisfaction </strong></p>\r\n<p>In today’s competitive business environment, customers expect vendors to not only deliver products on time, but to offer alerts and mobile minute-by-minute tracking features. Consumers, especially around the holidays, want and need to know the exact location and status of their order to determine if it will arrive on time. Businesses of all types expect the same sort of transparency in their own ordering processes.</p>\r\n<p>To facilitate this knowledge, customer service has never been more important. <a href=\"https://info.microsoft.com/rs/157-GQE-382/images/EN-CNTNT-Report-DynService-2017-global-state-customer-service.pdf\">Microsoft’s 2017 State of Global Customer Service Report</a> found that 54 percent of all customers and 66 percent of customers between 18 and 34 had higher expectations for service in 2017 than in 2016. And it pays to keep customers in the loop. In 2017, U.S. companies <a href=\"https://www.newvoicemedia.com/en-us/resources/serial-switchers-swayed-by-sentiment-how-bad-emotive-customer-experiences-are-costing-brands-billions\">lost $75 billion</a> from customers switching to competitors because of poor customer service.</p>\r\n<p>Order tracking applications are removing the confusion from the delivery process and keeping customer service levels high. Trucking companies use the apps to track drivers’ progress and head off a problem before it surfaces. Customers can utilize the apps to gain comfort that deliveries will make it on time. They also can check in to determine if an order might come in early to ensure their receiving depots are sufficiently staffed when orders arrive. Tracking apps can also help companies give time back to management, sales, and customer service staff that is typically spent handling customer inquiries related to their deliveries.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Fleet visibility </strong></p>\r\n<p>Transportation managers have long struggled with poor visibility into the status of their fleet operations. With dozens — if not hundreds — of workers out in the field at the same time, it can be difficult to keep track of productivity and operational efficiencies. Using mobile dispatching or telematics tools, managers can measure how routes are executed against scripted plans and access potentially unsafe driver behavior information.</p>\r\n<p>These applications can track lane departure warnings to determine whether a driver often drifts, hugs the shoulder, or changes lanes without signaling. Managers can use the frequency of hard braking alerts to find out how aggressive or attentive a driver is on the road.</p>\r\n<p>Instead of just counseling drivers on general ways to deal with these situations, data gives fleet managers the ability to get ahead of future problems. Managers can use data from mobile software as teaching tools. Rather than standardizing their training programs, managers can set up customized, consistent coaching techniques for every driver, focusing on areas of improvement and continuing to monitor subsequent driving behavior.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Worker productivity and engagement </strong></p>\r\n<p>Managers in the trucking industry are constantly looking for initiatives to help workers become more productive. <a href=\"https://blog.devicemagic.com/increase-productivity-in-transport-and-logistics\">Common strategies</a> such as working longer hours, optimizing vehicle fleets and transport routes, and improving data collection and administration are options to improve productivity, but may not be the best solution.</p>\r\n<p>Another solution is, simply, to engage with workers more. A <a href=\"https://www.officevibe.com/employee-engagement-solution/employee-feedback\">recent Officevibe Employee Feedback study</a> shows engaged employees are 27 percent more likely to perform well than those who are not. The same study found that a key way to engage employees is for managers to provide regular feedback. This can be done successfully using mobile tools.</p>\r\n<p>How important is feedback? The study cited above shows workers are twice as likely to be actively disengaged if they’re ignored by their manager. Four out of 10 workers are actively disengaged when they get little or no feedback, nearly two-thirds of employees want more feedback, and 82 percent of employees appreciate receiving feedback, regardless if it’s positive or negative.</p>\r\n<p>When drivers are off on routes, it’s easy for managers to slack off on the process of communicating and offering regular feedback. Mobile applications can provide a solution to this issue. Modern apps can be configured to provide guidance on the completion of tasks — verifying order quantities, collecting signatures, logging data — and offering feedback on how they’re performing relative to the day’s plan.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Going mobile</strong></p>\r\n<p>Mobile applications won’t solve every issue in the trucking industry, but they are providing helpful connections for companies looking for an edge. As technology continues to develop, management teams need to make mobile a bigger priority going forward.</p>\r\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-image-featured field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.omnitracs.com/sites/default/files/styles/blog_single/public/featured_image_2.1.19.jpg?itok=jBTMsZ32\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" /></div></div></div>",

          "title": "4 Tips to reduce weather-related crashes",
          "link": "https://www.omnitracs.com/blog/4-tips-reduce-weather-related-crashes",
          "content": "<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"><p>According to the <a href=\"https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/weather/q1_roadimpact.htm\">U.S. Department of Transportation</a> (DOT), more than 5.8 million vehicle crashes occur every year. Of those, approximately 21 percent, or just over 1.2 million, are weather-related.</p>\r\n<p>Rain, snow, sleet, fog, and crosswinds can significantly impact a driver’s ability to safely navigate the roadways. It’s critical that motorists take the proper precautions to prepare for and adapt to all adverse conditions. While crashes can occur during even the most pristine driving situations, there are certain things that drivers can do to increase safety and reduce the risk of an accident.</p>\r\n<p>Here are the top four ways drivers can safely operate their fleets in hazardous conditions:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Be cognizant of the weather</strong></p>\r\n<p>While there’s nothing drivers can do to escape certain elements, there are approaches they can implement to improve their overall safety. First, they need to be aware of any current or upcoming weather conditions and adjust accordingly. This means taking steps to prepare their vehicles, such as refilling their wiper fluid, adding tire chains or traction mats, replacing lights, and more. Next, they should proceed with caution, reducing their driving speed, increasing following distance, being hyperaware of other vehicles, turning on signals earlier before merging, and removing any ice or snow from their trucks. While drivers need to always be aware of their operating times and delivery schedules, they should use their best judgement to determine if and when to take a break due to inclement weather. If it’s too dangerous to continue driving, they should look for a safe place to pull over and wait until it’s safe to resume their routes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Take the most pptimal routes </strong></p>\r\n<p>Poor weather and driving conditions can cause congestion and increased travel time on the roadways. In fact, trucking companies or commercial vehicle operators (CVOs) <a href=\"https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/weather/q1_roadimpact.htm\">lose an estimated 32.6 billion vehicles hours</a> every year due to weather-related congestion and traffic accounts for nearly 12 percent of truck delays across the country. Therefore, it’s important that drivers do what they can to account for delays and congested roads and avoid them if at all possible.</p>\r\n<p>Drivers can leverage advanced navigation tools to find and follow the most efficient routes. While some drivers may be very familiar with their routes or prefer more traditional forms of navigation, they can greatly benefit by utilizing advanced technology. Solutions leverage real-time data to automatically populate the safest, most efficient routes that avoid traffic delays and weather-related issues as much as possible. These tools can also give visibility into hazardous routes including roads that are not well maintained or have low clearances, weight limits, or size restrictions. By utilizing historical traffic conditions, this software can help drivers bypass routes that may take extra time in the long run.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Avoid fatigue</strong></p>\r\n<p>Getting a good night’s rest may seem obvious, yet not all drivers make it a priority. The <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/drowsy-driving\">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> estimates that drowsy driving was responsible for 795 deaths in 2017, 90,000 crashes in 2015, and 4,121 fatal crashes between 2011 and 2015. To avoid being tired behind the wheel, drivers should make sure to get an appropriate amount of sleep during their off-time.</p>\r\n<p>While the <a href=\"https://www.omnitracs.com/the-eld-mandate\">ELD Mandate</a> has alleviated some pressures of driving at all hours, it’s important that drivers also make the conscious decision to pull off of the road and take a break during a long haul, if needed. The <a href=\"https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-news/the-problem-drowsy-driving\">AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety</a> reports that people who sleep 6-7 hours a night are twice as likely to be involved in a crash as those who sleep a full 8 hours. That extra hour is crucial to road safety. Fleets can help reduce the risk caused by fatigue by investing in <a href=\"https://www.omnitracs.com/products/omnitracs-fatigue-model\">technologies that leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning</a> that identify high-risk drivers, and take action before it’s too late.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Remove distractions      </strong></p>\r\n<p>When operating their vehicles, drivers need to worry about and consider a variety of factors, including their speed, other motorists on the road, how many hours they’re driving, and if they’re taking the most optimal routes. It’s crucial for drivers to remove any unnecessary distractions that may impair their abilities to operate their trucks safely. One of the most beneficial solutions: replace traditional communication tools with next-generation technology.</p>\r\n<p>Because it’s critical for fleets to maintain constant communication with drivers, managing this while driving can be a tricky and somewhat dangerous task. However, new mobile communication tools are transforming the transportation industry completely. Now, fleets have access to advanced telematics devices that feature text-to-talk and hands-free capabilities, allowing operators to reach drivers at all times without requiring drivers to take their eyes off of the road or hands off of their steering wheels. Instead of relying on cell phones to contact supervisors, drivers can now rely on <a href=\"https://www.omnitracs.com/products/omnitracs-driver-workflow\">these robust messaging tools</a>.</p>\r\n<p>While there are certain times that can be more dangerous than others for drivers on the road, there are ways they can reduce the likelihood of an accident. With the right processes and technology in place, you can give your drivers the tools they need<a href=\"https://www.omnitracs.com/products/omnitracs-driver-safety-model\"> to operate and arrive safely</a> at their destinations.</p>\r\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/blog/tags/safety\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">Safety</a></div><div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/blog/tags/vehicles\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">Vehicles</a></div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-image-featured field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.omnitracs.com/sites/default/files/styles/blog_single/public/safe_driving_blog_image.jpg?itok=gxwyGuNp\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" /></div></div></div>",

          "content": "<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"><p>2018 was a monumental year for the transportation industry. From existing companies unveiling innovative solutions, to new companies announcing next-generation technologies, it seemed as if a new offering was introduced to the market every day. Why? To provide the winning solution that meets consumer demands and revolutionizes the last mile.</p>\r\n<p>In today’s digital era, it’s clear that consumers expect convenient, fast, and personalized experiences in nearly every aspect of their lives, including how they shop for and receive products. To remain successful, it’s critical that transportation companies are always one step ahead, implementing the next big thing to redefine the consumer journey. </p>\r\n<p>Last year, the industry made significant steps forward, providing a glimpse into the advanced solutions that will transform delivery services for years to come. Below are the top trends leading the race in last-mile innovation. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Emphasis on energy efficiency </strong></p>\r\n<p>To excel in this rapidly evolving landscape, it’s important that companies continuously reassess processes and implement changes in real time. When it comes to fleet management, this is especially true. To succeed, companies not only have to maintain operations, but they must also place consumer preferences at the epicenter of all company decisions.</p>\r\n<p>Last year, both FedEx and UPS identified the need for more cost-effective and energy-efficient last-mile solutions. First, <a href=\"https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/FedEx-hydrogen-fuel-cell-van-pilot/522449/\">FedEx unveiled its pilot program</a> to test a hydrogen fuel cell, zero-emission delivery van, which allows drivers to reach more customers and reduce time wasted spent refueling. In addition, <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2018/05/09/ups-electric-trucks/\">UPS announced a partnership</a> with technology company Arrival to develop a pilot fleet of electric vehicles. With zero tailpipe emissions and a range of 150 miles, the trucks will be outfitted with Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) to help identify driver fatigue and improve overall safety. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Strategic partnerships </strong></p>\r\n<p>Another trend we’ve seen recently is top retailers investing in in-house delivery programs. Keeping innovation top-of-mind, many brands are partnering with, or acquiring, prominent technology companies to up level their delivery offerings and reinvigorate the consumer experience. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/walmart-partners-with-delivery-logistics-platform-bringg-on-last-mile-grocery-delivery/\">Walmart, for example, recently partnered with</a> delivery logistics platform Bringg, to develop Spark Delivery. The program, still in a pilot stage, leverages a crowdsourced model, allowing drivers to list their availability and be matched with online grocery orders and navigational information. Likewise, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/18/18146841/target-shipt-same-day-delivery-service-amazon-walmart\">Target announced at the end of 2018 that Shipt</a>, its same-day delivery service, will expand into new product categories, bringing items to consumers within as little as one hour.  </p>\r\n<p><strong>Advancements in autonomous delivery </strong></p>\r\n<p>In recent years, discussions around <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/technology/last-mile-delivery-in-search-of-solutions\">autonomous technology</a> have flooded the market, being hailed by some as the perfect solution for last-mile deliveries. However, it will likely be some time before we see self-driving trucks completely take over the roads. While developers are hard at work to refine the technology and develop smart roadways, many companies have entered the market with smaller-scale offerings. </p>\r\n<p>In 2018, for example, <a href=\"https://www.restaurantdive.com/news/doordash-hits-the-road-with-autonomous-vehicle-delivery/545271/\">DoorDash partnered with Cruise</a> to bring driverless vehicles to San Francisco to complete orders, and <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/kroger-to-begin-sending-robots-for-last-mile-grocery-delivery/\">Kroger released a pilot program</a> to test autonomous delivery in select areas. Also, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/5/31/17413836/alibaba-driverless-robot-deliver-packages-speed\">Alibaba unveiled a new robot</a> that will carry deliveries to consumers, featuring a storage locker that can only be opened with facial recognition, while <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2018/09/19/renault-unveils-autonomous-delivery-concept-ez-pro-with-customizable-robo-pods/https://venturebeat.com/2018/09/19/renault-unveils-autonomous-delivery-concept-ez-pro-with-customizable-robo-pods/\">Renault discussed plans</a> to develop an autonomous fleet that will hold robo-pods to reduce traffic and urban congestion. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Developments in drone technology</strong></p>\r\n<p>Lately, there has also been a lot of conversation around drone technology and its impact on the last mile. While drones present unmatched benefits to the transportation industry, such as the ability to reach rural areas faster, easier, and safer than traditional fleet delivery methods, we’re still years away from mainstream use. However, several companies recently indicated they’re working on advancing the technology and overcoming regulatory hurdles, revealing plans to implement drones for last-mile deliveries in the future.</p>\r\n<p>For example, Israeli-based <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2019/01/08/flytrex-raises-7-5-million-to-expand-drone-delivery-to-north-carolina/\">Flytex announced $7.5 million in funding last year</a>, which the company shared will be used to improve its existing drone delivery technology and launch a pilot program in North Carolina to test deliveries from restaurants to companies. Also, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/alphabet-unit-tests-new-system-to-identify-airborne-drones-11547417035\">Alphabet’s Inc Wing unit shared a new concept</a> that is aimed at tracking drones with advanced software applications, giving operators and government agencies access to real-time data that could help overcome some regulatory hurdles.  </p>\r\n<p><strong>What’s ahead </strong></p>\r\n<p>While advancing the last mile was a major focus in 2018, there’s no signs of the industry slowing down any time soon. At the Consumer Electronic Show (CES) in Las Vegas earlier this month, many companies introduced both new solutions and plans that will further disrupt processes and bring new innovations to the market. Some of the most prominent: <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/03/segway-unveils-a-more-durable-electric-scooter-and-autonomous-delivery-bot/\">Segway’s durable electric scooter and autonomous delivery bot</a>, <a href=\"https://www.truckinginfo.com/322661/ford-announces-last-mile-delivery-pilot-program-at-ces\">Ford’s self-driving delivery pilot program with Postmates</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/robot-delivery-dog-ces-2019/\">Continental’s robo dogs</a>.</p>\r\n<p>As technology continues to develop, it’s evident that traditional practices of getting goods to the consumer will be completely disrupted.
