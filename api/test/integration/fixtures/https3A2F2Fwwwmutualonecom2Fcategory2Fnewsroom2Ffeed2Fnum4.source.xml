<p>The MutualOne Charitable Foundation has awarded $2,500 to Jeff’s Place Children’s Bereavement Center in Framingham. The grant will support an additional Kid’s Club session focused on children between the ages of 3 and 7 who have experienced a traumatic loss in their lives.</p>



<p>Last year Jeff’s Place added a second Kid’s Club session in part thanks to support from the MutualOne Charitable Foundation, according to Executive Director David Sternburg.</p>



<p>“This demographic remains our fastest growing segment,” Sternburg said. “We need the third group session to serve families with younger children who are currently on our wait list.”</p>



<p>“These children are at a particularly delicate age for understanding and coping with traumatic loss,” said Steven M. Sousa, MutualOne Bank executive vice president and a MutualOne Charitable Foundation trustee. “We are pleased to help Jeff’s Place and the Kid’s Club program provide hope and healing.”</p>

<p>A recent $10,000 award from the MutualOne Charitable Foundation to Project Just Because will help provide local low-income families with school supplies and holiday items, according to Steven M. Sousa, executive vice president and chief operating officer of MutualOne Bank and a Foundation trustee.</p>



<p>The gift will support the Project Just Because Back to School initiative, which provides children with a backpack filled with school supplies, and its Holiday Wish List program, which distributes basic cold-weather necessities and small gift items to families in need. According to Cherylann Lambert Walsh, president and founder of Project Just Because, approximately 2,000 students received backpacks last year and over 15,000 Holiday Wish List packets were distributed.</p>



<p>“The number of our neighbors struggling to survive paycheck to paycheck is far greater than most of us realize,” said Sousa. “MutualOne is pleased to help provide support for those in the communities we serve when they are facing serious life challenges.”</p>
