That’s where she meets her polar opposite, confirmed bachelor Amersen Baudin: rich, handsome, cultured, and with an ego the size of the south of France. She puts him through his paces, but they soon discover they’ve got more in common than quick wits and sarcasm — they’ve both lost someone recently, and are struggling to cope in their own ways. This leads to tension, but with a bit of help from their families and the magic of Christmas in the City of Lights, they are reminded that “la grand amour” might be closer to home than they thought.</p>\n\n<p>Based on <a href=\"https://www.harlequin.com/shop/books/9781488014642_a-fortunes-of-texas-christmas.html\"><em>A Fortunes of Texas Christmas</em></a> by Helen Lacey</p>\n<p><strong>Where to watch:</strong></p>\n<p>December 8th at 7pm EST on UPtv</p>\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Baby in a Manger</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img src=\"https://harlequinblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/BabyInAManger_Keyart-709x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-41606\" width=\"355\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https://harlequinblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/BabyInAManger_Keyart-709x1024.jpg 709w, https://harlequinblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/BabyInAManger_Keyart-208x300.jpg 208w, https://harlequinblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/BabyInAManger_Keyart-768x1109.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Child protective services officer Alison and police officer Brock are both sworn to protect children, so when a lost infant shows up in the local church’s nativity scene, they’re both on the case. The pair don’t exactly gel right away — they’re both take-charge personalities and neither of them wants to let anything get in the way of the baby’s safe return home. This leads to tension between the two officers, but also internal tension. Alison will stop at nothing to keep the baby safe, but we learn she’s having doubts about whether she’s ready for kids of her own. Brock is also passionate about the case, but seems to be holding onto a secret from his past. Between butting heads, and with a little advice from a helpful minister, the pair learn plenty about each other, themselves, family, and the complicated bond between parent and child. Can a miracle baby from a broken home bring this community together?</p>\n\n<p>Based on &#8220;Child in a Manger&#8221; from <a href=\"https://www.harlequin.com/shop/books/9781459204768_a-family-for-christmas.html\"><em>A Family for Christmas</em></a> by Irene Brand and Dana Corbit</p>\n<p><strong>Where to watch:</strong></p>\n<p>December 24th at 7 pm EST on UPtv</p>\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n<p>Want to stay up to date on the Harlequin movie news?
