          "content": "<p><a href=\"https://www.pottedpotter.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Potted Potter: The Unauthorized Harry Experience- A Parody by Dan and Jeff</em></a> has made waves in Las Vegas since its debut in June of 2019. Daniel Clarkson and Jefferson Turner are the two actors behind the magical malarkey. The whole show is done by just the two of them, covering all seven books and the other 360 characters from the series in just 70 minutes!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Potted-Potter-Parody-Cast.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1293256 size-large\" src=\"http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Potted-Potter-Parody-Cast-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Potted-Potter-Parody-Cast-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Potted-Potter-Parody-Cast-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Potted-Potter-Parody-Cast-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Potted-Potter-Parody-Cast-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Potted-Potter-Parody-Cast-600x400.jpg 600w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Potted-Potter-Parody-Cast-520x347.jpg 520w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Potted-Potter-Parody-Cast.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After celebrated its <a href=\"http://www.mugglenet.com/2019/08/potted-potter-celebrates-100-shows-in-las-vegas/\">100th performance</a> at The Magic Attic showroom at Bally&#8217;s Las Vegas, the family-friendly show received two Best of Las Vegas awards; Best New Show (gold award) and Best Value Show (bronze award). It leaves us to wonder exactly how they manage such a sizeable feat with only two actors. Perhaps magic? But this witty take on <em>Harry Potter</em> is probably what earned Daniel and Jefferson their comedic standing and two awards in the industry. This is the first year <em>Potted Potter</em> won the Best of Las Vegas awards but seeing as the show is quickly rising through the ranks, it may not be it&#8217;s last.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://bestoflasvegas.com/2019-winners-menu.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">award winners</a> of 2019 Best of Las Vegas were ranked in several different categories including but not limited to food, entertainment, health and beauty, hotels and casinos, shopping, and things to do. Of those main categories, there were even more divisions for which businesses could win awards. 645 total businesses all over the Las Vegas area won either gold, silver, or bronze awards for their divisions. <em>Potted Potter</em> beat out <em>Celestia</em> and <em>FRIENDS! The Musical Parody</em> for the gold award in the Best New Show category. For Best Value Show, <em>Potted Potter</em> earned the bronze award.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Potted-Potter-Parody-Cast-2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1293257 size-large\" src=\"http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Potted-Potter-Parody-Cast-2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Potted-Potter-Parody-Cast-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Potted-Potter-Parody-Cast-2-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Potted-Potter-Parody-Cast-2-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Potted-Potter-Parody-Cast-2-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Potted-Potter-Parody-Cast-2-600x400.jpg 600w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Potted-Potter-Parody-Cast-2-520x347.jpg 520w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Potted-Potter-Parody-Cast-2.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The comedic two-man show portrays the world of <em>Harry Potter</em> in a wild and sometimes weird way.

          "content": "<p>From celebrity shout-outs to exclusive press opportunities to campaigns reminding us all about the unity of the <em>Harry Potter</em> fandom, MuggleNet.com has seen and done a lot in the past 20 years. This year, as we celebrate our 20th anniversary, we wanted to take a look back at some of the most memorable moments from the past two decades.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>1. J.K. Rowling&#8217;s &#8220;Mighty MuggleNet&#8221;</h4>\n<p>One of the biggest praises a fan site can get is being recognized and approved of by the creator whose work the site celebrates. MuggleNet was given this honor in 2004 when J.K. Rowling herself referred to us as “mighty MuggleNet” and bestowed upon us her “Fan Site Award.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s high time I paid homage to the mighty MuggleNet… Where to start? I love the design, …the polls, … the pretty-much exhaustive information… the wonderful editorials…. 101 Ways to Annoy Voldemort, (made me laugh out loud),… pretty much everything… I salute you.</p>\n<p>– J.K. Rowling</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>2. A Chance of a Lifetime Sit-Down Interview with J.K. Rowling</h4>\n<p>Imagine your home phone ringing and the woman on the other end saying they’re J.K. Rowling and asking you to tea. That’s exactly what happened to Emerson Spartz in 2005. Spartz and Melissa Anelli (from fellow fan site The Leaky Cauldron) were invited to do a joint interview with Rowling at her home in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1282212\" src=\"http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/emerson_melissa_jk-1024x445-1024x445.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"445\" srcset=\"http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/emerson_melissa_jk-1024x445.jpg 1024w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/emerson_melissa_jk-1024x445-300x130.jpg 300w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/emerson_melissa_jk-1024x445-768x334.jpg 768w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/emerson_melissa_jk-1024x445-150x65.jpg 150w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/emerson_melissa_jk-1024x445-600x261.jpg 600w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/emerson_melissa_jk-1024x445-520x226.jpg 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>MuggleNet’s Senior Contributing Editor Eric Scull refers to it as <em>“the interview that sank a ship.” </em>It was during the interview that Spartz called Harry/Hermione shippers <em>“delusional”</em> and Rowling admitted she’d always thought it was clear that Hermione would end up with Ron.</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;MuggleNet and the Leaky Cauldron were, to our knowledge, the only sites to receive this such honor, and it happened in the heyday of Harry,&#8221;</em> says Scull.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>3. A Casting Call Seen by the Right Person</h4>\n<p>In 2006, Evanna Lynch was scrolling through MuggleNet.com when she happened upon a post about an open casting call for Luna Lovegood. The rest, as they say, is history. Lynch has given MuggleNet shout-outs multiple times over the years as she’s rehashed the story of how she got the role in interviews.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fevylynchpage%2Fposts%2F847405931962856&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"368\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>4. <em>What Will Happen in Harry Potter 7?</em></h4>\n<p>In 2007, MuggleNet staff wrote a book theorizing about what would happen in the yet-to-be-named Book 7. That book, aptly titled <em>What Will Happen in Harry Potter 7?</em> , sold over 335,000 copies prior to the release of the seventh <em>Harry Potter</em> book and spent six months on the <em>New York Times</em> Children’s Bestseller List. The co-writers of the book embarked on a book tour that many of our current staff members remember attending.</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;When I read on the website that Emerson was going to be at my local Barnes and Noble, I begged my mom to take me so that I could buy it and get it signed. I remember making sure to get a good seat and would shush my mom because she had no idea what was going on,&#8221;</em> says Internship Coordinator Lizzie Sudlow.</p>\n<p><em>“On my 12th birthday, I made my mom drive me an hour away to a Borders where Emerson was giving a talk and holding a book signing for the What Will Happen in Harry Potter 7?</em> <em>book. Emerson signed my copy and tried to draw a birthday cake. He is not an artist,&#8221;</em> remembers Creative Team Manager Amy Hogan.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>5. The First <em>Harry Potter</em> Podcast Launches</h4>\n<p>The world of podcasting was still relatively new in 2005, and until <em>MuggleCast</em>, there weren’t any shows dedicated solely to <em>Harry Potter</em>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Launched in August 2005, <em>MuggleCast</em> brought a generation of <em>Harry Potter</em> fans fresh voices of their hyper-obsessed peers right into their ear holes on a weekly basis. Hosts laughed together, cried together, quipped, joked, and analyzed with each other and the bombastic listener base of around 50,000. (The podcast is STILL on the air and STILL weekly!) For me, doing the podcast taught me how to speak publicly and refine my thoughts, to analyze something I was passionate about, and to hear multiple contradictory opinions with &#8220;truth&#8221; being somewhere in the middle. Necessary life lessons.</p>\n<p>– Eric Scull, MuggleCast Host</p></blockquote>\n<p>Since then, MuggleNet has launched several other podcasts. Our current podcast family includes <em>Alohomora!</em>, <em>SpeakBeasty</em>, <em>Beyond The Veil</em>, <em>Reading, Writing, Rowling</em>, and <em>Accio Politics</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>6. Alan Rickman Tribute</h4>\n<p>On January 14, 2016, fans mourned the loss of Alan Rickman, arguably one of the greatest actors of his time. Weeks later, MuggleNet held a tribute to Rickman at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter &#8211; Diagon Alley during the park&#8217;s A Celebration of Harry Potter. Hundreds of fans filled the London area of the Orlando theme park, raising their wands and, in unison, reciting the word &#8220;always.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe title=\"Alan Rickman Tribute at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HkC2eiqIO9Q?feature=oembed&#038;wmode=opaque&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=http://www.mugglenet.com\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>7. Spellbound Event Draws Over 10,000 Attendees</h4>\n<p>On July 16, 2005, MuggleNet teamed up with fellow fan site HPANA and <em>Potter</em> companion book authors Wizarding World Press to throw a massive event in anticipation of the release of <em>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</em>.</p>\n<p>Spellbound, held at the Randhurst Mall in Mt. Prospect, Illinois, drew over 10,000 fans.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>8. Potter It Forward</h4>\n<p>In the fall of 2015, heartfelt notes from one <em>Potter</em> fan to the next began to appear tucked inside the pages of the books in stores and libraries. The <a href=\"http://www.mugglenet.com/fans-fun/potter-it-forward/\">#PotterItForward</a> campaign asked fans to leave a message for someone picking up a <em>Harry Potter</em> book for the first time.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It started as an idea that popped in my head on a long bus ride and from there our amazing team at MuggleNet brainstormed and fleshed out the logistics and official hashtag for the #PotterItForward campaign. The overwhelming response from the global <em>Harry Potter</em> community leaving notes and welcoming new readers into our midst just goes to show what an amazing and welcoming family this fandom is.</p>\n<p>– Amy Hogan, Creative Team Manager</p></blockquote>\n<p>The campaign took off, catching the attention of major media sites like Bustle, Buzzfeed, Mashable, and MTV, to name a few. J.K. Rowling herself acknowledged the campaign by liking a MuggleNet staff member’s tweet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>9. Appearing in the <em>New York Times</em> Crossword Puzzle</h4>\n<p>MuggleNet was part of a hint for the answer to 19 down in the <em>New York Times&#8217;</em> May 1, 2019 crossword puzzle.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>“For musicians, a fulfilling measure of success or growth would be to appear on the cover of Rolling Stone (as the Dr. Hook song says). For print and news media, or say, Harry Potter fan sites, the equivalent is the New York Times&#8217; Daily Crossword,&#8221;</em> says Eric Scull.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1282208\" src=\"http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MuggleNet-New-York-Times-Clue-474x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"474\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MuggleNet-New-York-Times-Clue-474x1024.jpeg 474w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MuggleNet-New-York-Times-Clue-139x300.jpeg 139w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MuggleNet-New-York-Times-Clue-150x324.jpeg 150w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MuggleNet-New-York-Times-Clue-600x1297.jpeg 600w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MuggleNet-New-York-Times-Clue-520x1124.jpeg 520w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MuggleNet-New-York-Times-Clue.jpeg 740w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The answer, of course, was &#8220;fansite.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>10. MuggleNet Live! 2017: 19 Years Later</h4>\n<p>On September 1, 2017, the <em>Harry Potter</em> fandom marked a significant date: the day and year on which the Epilogue takes place. MuggleNet threw a private party after hours in The Wizarding World of Harry Potter &#8211; Diagon Alley at Universal Studios Florida. Hundreds of fans showed up to celebrate the event, hobnobbing with cast members, eating as much butterbeer ice cream as they could take, and of course, boarding the Hogwarts Express from Platform 9 ¾.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1282215\" style=\"width: 970px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1282215\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1282215\" src=\"http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_6185.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_6185.jpg 960w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_6185-300x169.jpg 300w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_6185-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_6185-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_6185-600x338.jpg 600w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_6185-520x293.jpg 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1282215\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">MuggleNet staff members and <em>Harry Potter</em> actors celebrate a successful event after MuggleNet Live! 2017: 19 Years Later.</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Special <em>Potter</em> guests at the event were Sean Biggerstaff (Oliver Wood), Chris Rankin (Percy Weasley), Christian Coulson (Tom Riddle), Rohan Gotobed (young Sirius Black), Ellie Darcey-Alden (young Lily Potter), and Ryan Turner (Hugo Weasley).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>11. MuggleNet on the <em>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</em> Red Carpet</h4>\n<p>MuggleNet has been on our share of red carpets, but there&#8217;s something about fans lined up against the barricades chanting &#8220;MuggleNet, MuggleNet,&#8221; that still gives us chills.</p>\n<p>At the red carpet for the <em>Half-Blood Prince</em> film premiere, Emerson Spartz interviewed cast and crew members. There&#8217;s a really great exchange between Emerson and Daniel Radcliffe where they greet each other like old friends before diving into questions about the toughest scenes to film and what moments Dan was looking forward to filming in the next movie.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>12. Exclusive Partnership with <em>Newsweek</em></h4>\n<p>In October 2016, MuggleNet teamed up with <em>Newsweek</em>, contributing stories for their entirely <em>Potter</em> special edition. MuggleNet staff contributed two articles to the magazine.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Getting to write an article for <em>Newsweek</em> was an honor and huge learning experience. I had never before written for a publication the caliber of <em>Newsweek</em>. It was quite the magical experience to submit ‘Generation Potter’, work with the editors, and then see it in print. When it was published, I ran out to Barnes &amp; Noble and snapped pictures with the edition. I look forward to sharing the article with my kids one day and discussing how the <em>Harry Potter</em> stories shaped their generation.</p>\n<p>– Nicole Rivera, Former Creative Team Manager</p></blockquote>\n<p>That issue of the magazine was re-released the following year, and since that first partnership, we’ve helped <em>Newsweek</em> put together two more special editions focusing on the wizarding world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>13. Back on the Red Carpet for <em>Fantastic Beasts</em></h4>\n<p>Like we&#8217;ve said before, MuggleNet is no rookie when it comes to red carpets, but there was something truly thrilling about being back at a premiere for a wizarding world film years after we thought there would be no more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmugglenet%2Fvideos%2F10157683862890075%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All the A-listers were out in full force in New York City for the <em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</em> film premiere, including J.K. Rowling herself.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>14. MuggleNet in the News</h4>\n<p>MuggleNet has appeared in major publications and on network news several times throughout the years. Our resume includes appearances on <em>CBS</em>, <em>Fox News</em>, <em>BBC</em>, and <em>Al Jazeera</em>, as well as mentions in the<em> New York Times</em>, <em>Washington Post</em>, <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, and the<em> Wall Street Journal</em>, to name a few.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A worldwide quest to help everybody learn to capitalize the &#8220;N&#8221; in MuggleNet cannot succeed without good press. Through the many times MuggleNet has appeared in the news these last 20 years, proper spelling of our name is something we&#8217;re almost as passionate about as we are of <em>Harry Potter</em>! And the channels that get it right are bae &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3</p>\n<p>– Eric Scull, Senior Contributing Editor</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>15. April Fools&#8217; Pranks That Really Got People</h4>\n<p>If you’re a veteran MuggleNet follower, you’ve probably learned by this point to check your calendar before believing an article that seems unbelievable. Our staff has come up with some doozies for April Fools&#8217; Day over the years, some of which still circulate around the Internet from time to time. Our 2013 prank claiming Emma Watson had been cast as Ariel in a live-action version of <em>The Little Mermaid</em> even prompted a Snopes Fact Check. MuggleNet staffers even went so far as to Photoshop an image of Watson as Ariel to accompany the article.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The image seemed to really sell it because the story spread far and wide across the Internet. A year later, the first word of a real live-action Little Mermaid being in the works seemed to breathe new life into the Emma-as-Ariel rumor. The rumor and image still seem to pop up from time to time, with one live-action Little Mermaid released in 2018 and two more still in the works.</p>\n<p>– Catherine Lai, Senior News Administrator &amp; Copy Editor</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>16. MuggleNet Gets a &#8220;Thank You&#8221; for Coming to J.K. Rowling&#8217;s Defense</h4>\n<p>In May 2006, controversy erupted in the <em>Harry Potter</em> fandom, with claims that all overweight <em>Potter</em> characters were depicted as evil. MuggleNet staff member, Andy, compiled a list to prove that was not entirely accurate. J.K. Rowling thanked him by name on her website, saying he saved her precious time that she then spent writing the final chapter of the final <em>Harry Potter</em> book.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>17. MuggleNet Quoted on Posters for Off-Broadway Show <em>Puffs</em></h4>\n<p>When you have a <em>Harry Potter</em> parody show opening Off-Broadway and you need some reviews, who ya gonna call? MuggleNet, of course. When <em>Puffs, or Seven Increasingly Eventful Years at a Certain School of Magic and Magic</em> was playing off-Broadway, MuggleNet was invited to see the show and pen a review. Words from that rave review are still used on the show&#8217;s marketing materials all over New York City.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Anytime I’m lucky to be asked to handle review coverage I feel honored, but to actually find out that my review was so highly appreciated and coveted that a show would use it in its marketing materials is next level. I’ll never forget when I first found out my words were in print and blown up on subway ads.</p>\n<p>– Lizzie Sudlow, Internship Coordinator</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>18. MuggleNet Live! 2015: Expo Patronum</h4>\n<p>In April 2015 MuggleNet hosted its first-ever convention: MuggleNet Live! 2015: Expo Patronum. The event was held in London and was a chance for fans to interact with each other and cast members from the film series in an intimate setting. The guest list included Anna Shaffer, Afshan Azad, Georgina Leonidas, Jessie Cave, Natalia Tena, Robbie Jarvis, Nick Shirm, Harry Melling, Chris Rankin, Jon Campling, Nick Moran, Gary Tomkins, Eduardo Lima, and Miraphora Mina.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>19. A Social Media Frenzy Surrounds Mysterious Globus Mundi Theme Park Merch</h4>\n<p>When MuggleNet staff members spotted mysterious new merchandise in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter Universal Orlando Resorts, it sparked a flurry of questions from fans across Twitter. Subsequently, MuggleNet was the first to report that a new store would be opening in Diagon Alley: Globus Mundi Travel Agents.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe title=\"Globus Mundi Travel Agents: A Theme Park Mystery\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lV5IlKsx0pk?feature=oembed&#038;wmode=opaque&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=http://www.mugglenet.com\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During the course of our investigation, we stumbled upon a Globus Mundi Facebook page and Twitter account. Within 10 hours of our initial article pointing out the abundance of merchandise dedicated to the travel agency, the Globus Mundi Twitter account went from 6 followers to over 140, again showing just how influential &#8220;mighty MuggleNet&#8221; can be.</p>\n<p>We’re still not sure who owns the probably-not-so-official social media account, but we’re hoping that’s the next mystery that’s uncovered.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>20. Site Staff Quadrupled</h4>\n<p>In 2011 MuggleNet quadrupled the size of its staff by introducing internships. With the fandom in a transition period after the last film released, we needed to rethink our structure. In order to keep up with creating engaging and timely content, we needed more minds on board. Today, we have 130 staff members and 32 interns working on the site.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe title=\"20 of MuggleNet&#039;s Most Memorable Moments From The Past 20 Years\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NendNeDYdj0?feature=oembed&#038;wmode=opaque&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=http://www.mugglenet.com\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.mugglenet.com/2019/10/20-of-mugglenets-most-memorable-moments/\">20 of MuggleNet&#8217;s Most Memorable Moments</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.mugglenet.com\">MuggleNet</a>.</p>\n",
