<p>LAS VEGAS (August 29, 2019) Luxury has a new address. Berkshire Hathaway
HomeServices California Properties, a leader in Palm Springs area real estate,
has opened its first Luxury Collection series of offices in Indian Wells, a top
destination for luxury real estate.</p>



<p>“Our Indian Wells office is a boutique environment for both real estate
sales professionals that specialize in luxury real estate, and their clients
who require additional levels of service for their homes,” said Gordon Miles,
president and COO Americana Holdings, parent company of Berkshire Hathaway
HomeServices California Properties. “It is specially equipped to handle the
needs of our high net worth clients and the amenities required to sell their
homes quickly and for the highest possible price.” </p>



<p>Miles said the company’s second office designated in the Luxury
Collection series will be its downtown Palm Springs location. “There has been
unprecedented growth recently in the desert communities and these offices will
offer the world renowned Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices branding with our
additional offerings for luxury homes,” said Miles. “We are thrilled for the
opportunity to bring our brand to the beautiful Indian Wells community, which
is nationally known for its dedication to a luxury lifestyle.”</p>



<p>Indian Wells is recognized as one of the most exclusive residential communities
in the country, offering ultra-luxury homes and architecture that align with
the Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices brand. The desert oasis of Indian Wells is
home to exceptional resorts and spas, world-renowned golf and tennis facilities,
gorgeous desert scenery and unparalleled views of the surrounding San Jacinto
Mountains and the Santa Rosa Mountain range. The picturesque community features
a variety of luxury homes, ranging from traditional to modern architecture,
many of which are nestled just steps away from upscale country clubs and golf
resorts.</p>



<p>This is Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices California Properties’ first
office in Indian Wells and its sixth in the desert communities. The firm also
operates in La Quinta, Oasis Country Club, Palm Springs and Palm Desert.</p>



<p>Located in Indian Wells Village, the new office is located along one of
the busiest intersections in the city at the corner of Cook Street and Highway
111. It encompasses 7,000 square feet and offers the opportunity for continued
expansion within Indian Wells.</p>



<p>“Indian Wells Village is an ideal location to access a multitude of
incredible residential communities throughout the city,” said Mark Stark, CEO
of Americana Holdings. “The location will allow
our sales executives to meet clients in a more centralized location, which in
turn will improve efficiency and ensure they receive the best possible service.”</p>



<p>The office offers more than 6,000 square feet of collaborative space with
modern technology capabilities and access to all Berkshire Hathaway
HomeServices sales and marketing platforms.&nbsp;
The dual design space features custom, private offices and numerous open
spaces to improve overall social interaction. “This modern design encourages
collaboration, with an environment that is not easily achieved in conventional
office spaces,” said Miles. </p>



<p>The firm will service homes in a variety of
Indian Wells upscale communities, including Indian&nbsp;Wells&nbsp;Country
Club, Desert Horizons Country Club, Toscana Country Club, Vintage Club and
Reserve Club.</p>

<p><strong><em>Anaheim

to all their clients. It’s simply incredible and extremely admirable that they
continue to enhance their already stellar service year after year.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Respected real estate research firm REAL Trends identifies the nation’s
leading firms and agents and ranks them by closed transaction sides and closed
sales. The Geronsins were recognized for their substantial sales volume in 2018.
The team sold $138.51 million last year and completed more than 120 transactions
in Southern California real estate.</p>



<p>The Geronsins are a family-based firm specializing in North Orange County
properties. Led by Carole Geronsin and her partners, Genelle
Geronsin-Vandenboss and George Geronsin, The Geronsins operate an executive
boutique-style business with the support of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices and
its global capabilities. The team brings a combined 65-plus years’ experience
in the industry and offers a level of customer service unmatched by any other
firm in the region. </p>

our only client we serve,” Carole said. </p>

<p>The company will operate as Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices LARVIA starting in late July.<br></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.bhhscaproperties.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2019/07/Bruno_Rabassa_and_Claudio_Prattico_002.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-817" srcset="https://www.bhhscaproperties.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2019/07/Bruno_Rabassa_and_Claudio_Prattico_002.jpg 480w, https://www.bhhscaproperties.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2019/07/Bruno_Rabassa_and_Claudio_Prattico_002-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /><figcaption><strong>Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices LARVIA CEO Bruno Rabassa (left) and Claudio Prattico, managing director of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices, finalize LARVIA’s network agreement. (Photo: Business Wire)</strong><br><br></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>LARVIA is part of Petrus Grupo Inmobiliario, which has been developing, restoring, leasing and managing property in the region since 1964. LARVIA, led by CEO Bruno Rabassa, is respected throughout the country for its expertise, client service and integrity. It specializes in luxury real estate among other sectors.</p>



<p>“Spain has always been a primary target of our global expansion,” said Gino Blefari, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices. “The country is welcoming with incredible people, rich history and culture, and it’s a vital hub for global trade, tourism and commerce. As important, we enter the market with a strong and respected agency. LARVIA will connect our network to the region and beyond, as Spain is a center for many European and Latin American clients.”</p>



<p>LARVIA marks the fifth global network member of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices in the last 16 months, following Rubina Real Estate in Berlin; Kay &amp; Co, London; Maggi Properties, Milan; and Gulf Properties, Dubai. Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices is one of the America’s fastest-growing and respected real estate brokerage networks with nearly 50,000 agents and 1,450+ offices joining its ranks in less than six years, and more than $114.5 billion in sales generated in 2018.</p>



<p>“We are proud to represent Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices in Spain,” said Rabassa. “The brand’s namesake is Berkshire Hathaway Inc., one of the world’s most trusted and respected corporations. As important, we join a network of strong and thriving companies, and we look forward to exchanging client referrals and best practices with those companies.”</p>



<p>Rabassa said he plans to grow LARVIA in Madrid, Barcelona and other key markets in Spain, and will launch an aggressive recruiting campaign seeking more of the best agents in the market. “We hope to double our current size in Madrid and Barcelona within a year,” he explained. “After that, we will expand to other strategic markets. The message is clear for local estate agents: If you want to take your career to new heights with a respected Spanish estate agency, and also connect with a thriving global real estate network, we want to talk to you.”</p>



<p>LARVIA gains access to Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices’ “FOREVER Cloud” technology suite, a powerful source for lead generation, marketing support, social media, video production/distribution and more. Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices has aligned with Salesforce to deliver world-class technology support to its network members far into the future. The brand also provides global listing syndication, relocation referrals, professional training and the exclusive Luxury Collection marketing program for premier listings. Its Prestige Magazine showcases network members’ premium listings with a compelling lineup of feature stories covering topics that appeal to high-end real estate consumers.</p>



<p>Rabassa said the timing for his company’s brand transition is ideal, as the Spanish real estate market has recovered from the great downturn and continues moving forward. Of course, Spain remains one of Europe’s finest destinations with high demand from global investors.</p>



<p>“Our decision to join Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices is all about providing real estate consumers with the best service and consultation for decades to come,” Rabassa explained. “We all are very excited for the future.”</p>



<p>Chris Stuart, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices, welcomed LARVIA. “Bruno Rabassa is highly engaged in the Madrid business community, and the family is well respected in the region for its decades of quality service and success. We are absolutely thrilled that LARVIA will be our Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices brand ambassador in Spain.”</p>



<p><strong>About Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices LARVIA</strong></p>



<p>LARVIA will join the Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices network in late July. The estate agency was founded in 2012 by CEO Bruno Rabassa. The Rabassa family has been involved in the development of real estate as Petrus Grupo Inmobiliario since 1964.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This week Americana Holdings, the largest independently owned Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices franchise, worked with three other Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices franchise members to acquire Tarbell, Realtors® which operated 20 offices in Southern California.</p>



<p>Americana Holdings now has more than 3,200 real estate sales executives in Nevada, Arizona and California. It acquired 11 Tarbell, Realtors offices in the merger, located in Orange County and desert communities in and around Palm Springs. Tarbell is one of California’s most respected family-owned real estate firms with $1.1 billion in sales last year.</p>



<p>Mark Stark, CEO of Americana Holdings, said Tarbell’s reputation for culture made it an ideal fit for his company. “Culture is everything,” he said. “To find a company with the same thought process and has treated their people in such a positive and supportive manner is key. It’s unusual to find two organizations so committed to their people and to sustaining a quality culture – we’re a great match. We look forward to sharing all our support in helping these professionals further grow their businesses and provide even more value and service to their clients.”</p>

<p>“We’re excited to have found a real estate network that shares the same passion for the business that my family has had for generations,” said Ron Tarbell, CEO of Tarbell, Realtors®. “Our company’s standards of integrity, professionalism and service to the communities we serve are perfectly aligned with those of the Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices brand.”</p>



<p>Tarbell, Realtors® offices that have joined Americana Holdings’ Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices California Properties are located in Anaheim Hills, Lake Elsinore, La Quinta, Murrieta (French Valley and Menifee), Oasis Country Club, Palm Desert, Palm Springs, Temecula, Upland and Yorba Linda. Tarbell’s remaining offices were acquired by Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices franchises based in San Diego, Redlands and Cerritos.</p>



<p>“This merger continues the expansion of our California market presence, which has been a focus for our company,” said Gordon Miles, president and COO of Americana Holdings. “It continues to enhance our footprint in our Orange County and desert communities, while opening opportunities in new areas in which we weren’t previously represented.”</p>



<p>Miles said all of Americana Holdings offices in Nevada, Arizona and California will benefit from its expansion. “Our tri-state network is especially beneficial for California’s continued migration to Nevada and Arizona. We offer our clients streamlined service from California into the Nevada and Arizona markets. We are thrilled to continue growing as a dynamic, emerging company that supports both customers and agents by utilizing the latest technology to provide unsurpassed service.”</p>



<p>“Our primary objective at Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices is to help our network members grow,” said Gino Blefari, chairman of the network. “We are delighted to announce this transaction as Tarbell, Realtors® has a strong and distinguished legacy in the marketplace and has always attracted top real estate professionals. These professionals will further strengthen our brand and add significant value to the brokerages involved.”</p>

<p>BHHS partners with Adwerx to offer Realtors new program.</p>



<p>Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Nevada Properties, in partnership with Adwerx Enterprises, has launched a new platform, called Brilliantly Simple, to immediately advertise its real estate listings online. The platform automatically creates digital advertising programs for each home, including custom ads that are optimized for social media, apps and websites.</p>



<p>“We are relentless in the pursuit of technology that can help our clients sell their homes faster and for the best possible price,” said Gordon Miles, president and chief operating officer of Americana Holdings, parent company of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Nevada Properties.</p>



<p>Miles said the first week of a home’s listing is a critical time for advertising it to potential buyers.</p>



<p>“It also re-targets those who have either viewed the home online or visited the agent online to expand the conversation and drive prospective clients to the home,” he said.</p>



<p>The new Adwerx platforms also bring the power of streaming television to every Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Nevada Properties sales executive.</p>



<p>“They (the agents) will be able to deliver high-quality video and commercials about their personal brands and the homes they have listed for sale, directly into services like Hulu and Roku, as well as premium streaming channels,” Miles said. “It is a multifaceted platform that uses the most powerful communications vehicles to communicate with prospective clients.”</p>



<p>Mark Stark, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Nevada Properties, said the platform gives his team of nearly 3,000 real estate sales executives in Nevada, Arizona and California an unprecedented advantage in marketing their clients’ home listings.</p>



<p>The company has made major investments in technology and data in the past several years, with other programs including:</p>



<p>■ A data analysis platform that helps real estate sales executives match buyers with potential new homes. The web-based platform, created by real estate analytics company Buyside, feeds search data from major real estate sites such as Zillow, Trulia and Realtor.com into one central location.</p>



<p>■ A partnership with Juwai.com, which showcases its home listings to an average of 2 million potential buyers in China daily.</p>



<p>■ An expanded partnership with Zillow Instant Offers, which connects homeowners to a comparative analysis from a local Zillow Premier Agent, along with offers from investors.</p>



<p>Americana Holdings operates Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Nevada Properties, Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Arizona Properties and Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices California Properties. The firms are leaders in their respective markets with 28 offices and nearly 3,000 real estate sales executives, comprising the largest independently owned Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices franchise in the world. Combined, the companies sold $5.2 billion in real estate in 2018. For more information, visit www.bhhsnv.com or follow the company on Instagram and Facebook.</p>
