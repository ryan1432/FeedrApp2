<p>Meet Agnieszka Maciejewski, Branch Manager of our New Canaan location.</p>



<p><strong>Tell us a little about yourself.</strong><br>I was born in Poland (hence&#8230; my name) and I have a ten-year-old daughter named Layla &#8211; she is my biggest cheerleader. I’m passionate about valuing the little joys in life and being positive. There is a lot of chaos going on around us on a daily basis, and I feel it’s important to take a second and appreciate the little things that make us happy. I love to travel and explore new countries, learn new cultures and make new friends. My all-time favorite traveling companion is my daughter; she’s also my favorite golf partner &#8211; who I let win sometimes. </p>



<p><strong>Do you have a secret talent?</strong><br>My hidden talent lies in artistic endeavors. I have a heightened appreciation for modern art and interior design. I enjoy creating and moving things around, giving my space a whole new look and feel.</p>



<p><strong>What is your favorite part of your role with First County Bank?</strong><br>I pride myself in helping my customers set and achieve their financial goals. It is so rewarding knowing that I am making a positive impact on my customers’ lives. As a First County Bank Trusted Advisor we focus on community, values, feelings and goals, all of which I take into account with every customer I work with.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have a favorite First County Bank moment?</strong><br>Every day is my favorite First County Bank moment.  I am so fortunate to be able to work with such a great team of bright and skilled people, who employ a strong work ethic and attentive customer service.</p>

<p>Whether you have signed up to receive food, clothes, makeup or pet products, subscription services can be a fun and convenient way to shop. </p>



<p>But, because the payments become automatic once you enroll, it can be easy to lose track of how much you are spending each month.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s a good idea to review the services you’ve subscribed to regularly. </p>



<p>Start by looking through your credit card or banking statements to see how much you are spending. Try downloading an app to help you account for all your subscriptions. Don’t forget to check for subscriptions to newspapers and magazines, as well as streaming music and entertainment services.</p>



<p>Once you have a list, you can figure out if you are still using each service. While it may not seem like much, canceling even one $10 monthly subscription can add up to big savings in the long run.</p>

<p><strong>Tell us a little about yourself.</strong><br>I have been with First County Bank for over 16 years, and enjoy volunteering and representing the Bank in the community.<br><br>I really like being involved in Norwalk, the city that I call home, where I live with my husband and two boys Nicolas and Luke. When I am not at work, I love to travel and enjoy spending quality time with my family and friends. I am also very active in my community as a member of the Norwalk Chamber, and recently became a board member of the nonprofit organization, Keystone House.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have a secret talent?</strong><br>I love to decorate!  I feel like I’m an amateur interior designer. I like to transform rooms and create new spaces with colors, furnishings, and accessories. It’s a great feeling to visualize a space and then see the final result come to life!</p>



<p><strong>What is your favorite part of your role with First County Bank?</strong><br>My favorite part of my role as a branch manager is building long term banking relationships and providing excellent customer service. It is very rewarding to know customers trust me and come to me for all their financial needs. I enjoy helping people in the community, solving problems, interacting with customers, and assisting them with all their diverse financial needs.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have a favorite First County Bank moment?</strong><br>I would have to say many of my favorite moments are when customers that I have helped come back in just to say thank you.  To me, that is one of the most rewarding parts of my job.</p>



<p><strong>Is there anything else you’d like to say about you or your experience at the Bank?</strong><br>I recently participated in the Norwalk Chamber leadership program where I had the opportunity to connect with some great leaders in my community while learning about the new development and growth in Norwalk. Being able to participate in this program is another great example of how First County Bank supports the growth and prosperity of their employees.</p>

<p>Shopping without taking out your wallet keeps getting easier. </p>



<p>You may already be comfortable paying for your items with your smartphone – but did you know you can also pay with your smartwatch? From buying groceries to shopping for new shoes, you no longer have to dig through your purse or pockets to find your card OR your device – all you have to do is tap and go!</p>



<p>To get started, make sure your smartwatch has a mobile wallet or payment app such as Google Pay<sup>®</sup>, Apple Pay<sup>®</sup> or Samsung Pay<sup>®</sup>. </p>



<p>Using your smartwatch’s app, add your First County Bank Debit or credit card as your default card.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright is-resized"><img src="http://blog.firstcountybank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ContactLess_Payment_1085466710.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1030" width="165" height="113"/><figcaption>Contactless payment symbol</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Then when you go shopping, look for the contactless payment symbol, or the symbol for your device (such as Google Pay or Apple Pay). With just a few taps, the payment will be made and you’ll be on your way!</p>



<p>Have questions or difficulties adding your First County Bank debit or credit card to your mobile wallet or payment app? <a href="https://www.firstcountybank.com/branch-hours-locations-and-directions">Stop by any of our branches and a Digital Ambassador will be able to help.</a> </p>

<p>Our team had a blast volunteering recently at a Build Day with Habitat for Humanity of Coastal Fairfield County (CFC)! The team worked on building a house on Center Street in Bridgeport, CT hammering nails to the wall frames while working on scaffolding.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This is the second time the Bank has participated in a Build Day event. Our volunteers find it very rewarding to give back to the community. Thank you to Steven Ferguson, Stephanie Frederick, Shaun Intriago, Goretti Joseph, Sebastian Kulesza, Colin Terrell, and Anna Kosakowski for their hard work.</p>

<p>The seasons are changing, and the latest fashion trends are here. Now you’re thinking, “Do I need new clothes?” We’ve got some tips for you to make sure you stay fashion-forward this season, without having to think twice about spending too much money.<br> &nbsp;<br><strong>Don’t buy into all the trends.</strong> <br>Just because “everyone” is wearing the hottest fashion does not mean that you have to follow the herd. Focus on being yourself, and buying what you like. Or, you don’t even have to buy anything at all. &nbsp;Dig some old stuff out of the closet, or do a little DIY on what you have. Even that can give you a fresh “new” look.<br> &nbsp;<br><strong>Never pay retail price. </strong><br>With so many discounts and coupons available, there is no reason you should ever have to pay the full price for something you want. This could mean being patient, waiting for when the sales happen online and at retail stores. You could also skip the wait, and check out outlet stores like Marshalls®, and discount online retailers like Poshmark<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. For the extra discounts, sign up for email coupons with your favorite brands, use apps like RetailMeNot<sup>®</sup>, and take advantage of student, military, senior, &nbsp;and AAA<sup><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></sup> discounts. The seasons are changing, and the latest fashion trends are here. Now you’re thinking, “Do I need new clothes?” We’ve got some tips for you to make sure you stay fashion-forward this season, without having to think twice about spending too much money.<br> &nbsp;<br><strong>Consider buying and selling used.</strong> <br>Since retro clothing is all the rage right now, it is a great time to shop for used vintage clothes on eBay<sup>®</sup> and at thrift stores. You can sell unwanted clothes in good condition as well on these sites, to make a few dollars and some room in the closet for your new (or used) swag. Also, think about trading clothes with friends. A fresh new look for the both of you? That’s a win-win.<br> &nbsp;<br><strong>Quality over quantity.</strong> <br>It is tempting to buy cheap, low-quality new clothes to get you through the season or a new trend. Over time, however, the constant spending adds up as those clothes continue to deteriorate. Depending on the item, it may be better to purchase the option that is more timeless, versatile, and durable. If anything, due to the high quality of the item, you may even be able to resell it when you are finished with it. More expensive, higher quality stuff is an investment!Just because “everyone” is wearing the hottest fashion does not mean that you have to follow the herd.
