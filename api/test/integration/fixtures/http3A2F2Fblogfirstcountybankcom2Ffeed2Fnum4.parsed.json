I’m passionate about valuing the little joys in life and being positive. There is a lot of chaos going on around us on a daily basis, and I feel it’s important to take a second and appreciate the little things that make us happy. I love to travel and explore new countries, learn new cultures and make new friends. My all-time favorite traveling companion is my daughter; she’s also my favorite golf partner &#8211; who I let win sometimes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do you have a secret talent?</strong><br>My hidden talent lies in artistic endeavors. I have a heightened appreciation for modern art and interior design. I enjoy creating and moving things around, giving my space a whole new look and feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is your favorite part of your role with First County Bank?</strong><br>I pride myself in helping my customers set and achieve their financial goals. It is so rewarding knowing that I am making a positive impact on my customers’ lives. As a First County Bank Trusted Advisor we focus on community, values, feelings and goals, all of which I take into account with every customer I work with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do you have a favorite First County Bank moment?</strong><br>Every day is my favorite First County Bank moment.  I am so fortunate to be able to work with such a great team of bright and skilled people, who employ a strong work ethic and attentive customer service.</p>\n",

Try downloading an app to help you account for all your subscriptions. Don’t forget to check for subscriptions to newspapers and magazines, as well as streaming music and entertainment services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have a list, you can figure out if you are still using each service. While it may not seem like much, canceling even one $10 monthly subscription can add up to big savings in the long run.</p>\n",
