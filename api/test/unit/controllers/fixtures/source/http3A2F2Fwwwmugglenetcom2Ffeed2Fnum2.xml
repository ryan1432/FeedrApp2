								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.pottedpotter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Potted Potter: The Unauthorized Harry Experience- A Parody by Dan and Jeff</em></a> has made waves in Las Vegas since its debut in June of 2019. Daniel Clarkson and Jefferson Turner are the two actors behind the magical malarkey. The whole show is done by just the two of them, covering all seven books and the other 360 characters from the series in just 70 minutes!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Potted-Potter-Parody-Cast.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1293256 size-large" src="http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Potted-Potter-Parody-Cast-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Potted-Potter-Parody-Cast-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Potted-Potter-Parody-Cast-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Potted-Potter-Parody-Cast-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Potted-Potter-Parody-Cast-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Potted-Potter-Parody-Cast-600x400.jpg 600w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Potted-Potter-Parody-Cast-520x347.jpg 520w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Potted-Potter-Parody-Cast.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After celebrated its <a href="http://www.mugglenet.com/2019/08/potted-potter-celebrates-100-shows-in-las-vegas/">100th performance</a> at The Magic Attic showroom at Bally&#8217;s Las Vegas, the family-friendly show received two Best of Las Vegas awards; Best New Show (gold award) and Best Value Show (bronze award). It leaves us to wonder exactly how they manage such a sizeable feat with only two actors. Perhaps magic? But this witty take on <em>Harry Potter</em> is probably what earned Daniel and Jefferson their comedic standing and two awards in the industry. This is the first year <em>Potted Potter</em> won the Best of Las Vegas awards but seeing as the show is quickly rising through the ranks, it may not be it&#8217;s last.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bestoflasvegas.com/2019-winners-menu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">award winners</a> of 2019 Best of Las Vegas were ranked in several different categories including but not limited to food, entertainment, health and beauty, hotels and casinos, shopping, and things to do. Of those main categories, there were even more divisions for which businesses could win awards. 645 total businesses all over the Las Vegas area won either gold, silver, or bronze awards for their divisions. <em>Potted Potter</em> beat out <em>Celestia</em> and <em>FRIENDS! The Musical Parody</em> for the gold award in the Best New Show category. For Best Value Show, <em>Potted Potter</em> earned the bronze award.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The comedic two-man show portrays the world of <em>Harry Potter</em> in a wild and sometimes weird way. Regardless, fans seem to be hungry for more! <em>Potted Potter</em> has extended its performances through January 5, 2020, with additional showtimes during the holiday season.</p>
<p>Before landing in Las Vegas, <em>Potted Potter: The Unauthorized Harry Experience</em> had audiences <a href="https://www.broadwayworld.com/las-vegas/article/POTTED-POTTER-Wins-TwoBest-Of-Las-Vegas-Awards-20191015" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worldwide</a> laughing. Theaters have been sold out in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Dubai, and Canada.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ticketmaster.com/potted-potter-tickets/artist/84173?venueId=467871" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tickets</a> are available for daily shows in Las Vegas through January 2020.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>From sit-down interviews with J.K. Rowling to red carpets to viral social media campaigns, MuggleNet has done a lot in the past 20 years. To celebrate our 20th anniversary, we're taking a trip down memory lane.</p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mugglenet.com/2019/10/20-of-mugglenets-most-memorable-moments/">20 of MuggleNet&#8217;s Most Memorable Moments</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mugglenet.com">MuggleNet</a>.</p>
]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From celebrity shout-outs to exclusive press opportunities to campaigns reminding us all about the unity of the <em>Harry Potter</em> fandom, MuggleNet.com has seen and done a lot in the past 20 years. This year, as we celebrate our 20th anniversary, we wanted to take a look back at some of the most memorable moments from the past two decades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>1. J.K. Rowling&#8217;s &#8220;Mighty MuggleNet&#8221;</h4>
<p>One of the biggest praises a fan site can get is being recognized and approved of by the creator whose work the site celebrates. MuggleNet was given this honor in 2004 when J.K. Rowling herself referred to us as “mighty MuggleNet” and bestowed upon us her “Fan Site Award.”</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s high time I paid homage to the mighty MuggleNet… Where to start? I love the design, …the polls, … the pretty-much exhaustive information… the wonderful editorials…. 101 Ways to Annoy Voldemort, (made me laugh out loud),… pretty much everything… I salute you.</p>
<p>– J.K. Rowling</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2. A Chance of a Lifetime Sit-Down Interview with J.K. Rowling</h4>
<p>Imagine your home phone ringing and the woman on the other end saying they’re J.K. Rowling and asking you to tea. That’s exactly what happened to Emerson Spartz in 2005. Spartz and Melissa Anelli (from fellow fan site The Leaky Cauldron) were invited to do a joint interview with Rowling at her home in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1282212" src="http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/emerson_melissa_jk-1024x445-1024x445.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="445" srcset="http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/emerson_melissa_jk-1024x445.jpg 1024w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/emerson_melissa_jk-1024x445-300x130.jpg 300w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/emerson_melissa_jk-1024x445-768x334.jpg 768w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/emerson_melissa_jk-1024x445-150x65.jpg 150w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/emerson_melissa_jk-1024x445-600x261.jpg 600w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/emerson_melissa_jk-1024x445-520x226.jpg 520w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MuggleNet’s Senior Contributing Editor Eric Scull refers to it as <em>“the interview that sank a ship.” </em>It was during the interview that Spartz called Harry/Hermione shippers <em>“delusional”</em> and Rowling admitted she’d always thought it was clear that Hermione would end up with Ron.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;MuggleNet and the Leaky Cauldron were, to our knowledge, the only sites to receive this such honor, and it happened in the heyday of Harry,&#8221;</em> says Scull.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3. A Casting Call Seen by the Right Person</h4>
<p>In 2006, Evanna Lynch was scrolling through MuggleNet.com when she happened upon a post about an open casting call for Luna Lovegood. The rest, as they say, is history. Lynch has given MuggleNet shout-outs multiple times over the years as she’s rehashed the story of how she got the role in interviews.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fevylynchpage%2Fposts%2F847405931962856&amp;width=500" width="500" height="368" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>4. <em>What Will Happen in Harry Potter 7?</em></h4>
<p>In 2007, MuggleNet staff wrote a book theorizing about what would happen in the yet-to-be-named Book 7. That book, aptly titled <em>What Will Happen in Harry Potter 7?</em> , sold over 335,000 copies prior to the release of the seventh <em>Harry Potter</em> book and spent six months on the <em>New York Times</em> Children’s Bestseller List. The co-writers of the book embarked on a book tour that many of our current staff members remember attending.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;When I read on the website that Emerson was going to be at my local Barnes and Noble, I begged my mom to take me so that I could buy it and get it signed. I remember making sure to get a good seat and would shush my mom because she had no idea what was going on,&#8221;</em> says Internship Coordinator Lizzie Sudlow.</p>
<p><em>“On my 12th birthday, I made my mom drive me an hour away to a Borders where Emerson was giving a talk and holding a book signing for the What Will Happen in Harry Potter 7?</em> <em>book. Emerson signed my copy and tried to draw a birthday cake. He is not an artist,&#8221;</em> remembers Creative Team Manager Amy Hogan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>5. The First <em>Harry Potter</em> Podcast Launches</h4>
<p>The world of podcasting was still relatively new in 2005, and until <em>MuggleCast</em>, there weren’t any shows dedicated solely to <em>Harry Potter</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Launched in August 2005, <em>MuggleCast</em> brought a generation of <em>Harry Potter</em> fans fresh voices of their hyper-obsessed peers right into their ear holes on a weekly basis. Hosts laughed together, cried together, quipped, joked, and analyzed with each other and the bombastic listener base of around 50,000. (The podcast is STILL on the air and STILL weekly!) For me, doing the podcast taught me how to speak publicly and refine my thoughts, to analyze something I was passionate about, and to hear multiple contradictory opinions with &#8220;truth&#8221; being somewhere in the middle. Necessary life lessons.</p>
<p>– Eric Scull, MuggleCast Host</p></blockquote>
<p>Since then, MuggleNet has launched several other podcasts. Our current podcast family includes <em>Alohomora!</em>, <em>SpeakBeasty</em>, <em>Beyond The Veil</em>, <em>Reading, Writing, Rowling</em>, and <em>Accio Politics</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>6. Alan Rickman Tribute</h4>
<p>On January 14, 2016, fans mourned the loss of Alan Rickman, arguably one of the greatest actors of his time. Weeks later, MuggleNet held a tribute to Rickman at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter &#8211; Diagon Alley during the park&#8217;s A Celebration of Harry Potter. Hundreds of fans filled the London area of the Orlando theme park, raising their wands and, in unison, reciting the word &#8220;always.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="video-container"><iframe title="Alan Rickman Tribute at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HkC2eiqIO9Q?feature=oembed&#038;wmode=opaque&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=http://www.mugglenet.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>7. Spellbound Event Draws Over 10,000 Attendees</h4>
<p>On July 16, 2005, MuggleNet teamed up with fellow fan site HPANA and <em>Potter</em> companion book authors Wizarding World Press to throw a massive event in anticipation of the release of <em>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</em>.</p>
<p>Spellbound, held at the Randhurst Mall in Mt. Prospect, Illinois, drew over 10,000 fans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>8. Potter It Forward</h4>
<p>In the fall of 2015, heartfelt notes from one <em>Potter</em> fan to the next began to appear tucked inside the pages of the books in stores and libraries. The <a href="http://www.mugglenet.com/fans-fun/potter-it-forward/">#PotterItForward</a> campaign asked fans to leave a message for someone picking up a <em>Harry Potter</em> book for the first time.</p>
<blockquote><p>It started as an idea that popped in my head on a long bus ride and from there our amazing team at MuggleNet brainstormed and fleshed out the logistics and official hashtag for the #PotterItForward campaign. The overwhelming response from the global <em>Harry Potter</em> community leaving notes and welcoming new readers into our midst just goes to show what an amazing and welcoming family this fandom is.</p>
<p>– Amy Hogan, Creative Team Manager</p></blockquote>
<p>The campaign took off, catching the attention of major media sites like Bustle, Buzzfeed, Mashable, and MTV, to name a few. J.K. Rowling herself acknowledged the campaign by liking a MuggleNet staff member’s tweet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>9. Appearing in the <em>New York Times</em> Crossword Puzzle</h4>
<p>MuggleNet was part of a hint for the answer to 19 down in the <em>New York Times&#8217;</em> May 1, 2019 crossword puzzle.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>“For musicians, a fulfilling measure of success or growth would be to appear on the cover of Rolling Stone (as the Dr. Hook song says). For print and news media, or say, Harry Potter fan sites, the equivalent is the New York Times&#8217; Daily Crossword,&#8221;</em> says Eric Scull.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1282208" src="http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MuggleNet-New-York-Times-Clue-474x1024.jpeg" alt="" width="474" height="1024" srcset="http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MuggleNet-New-York-Times-Clue-474x1024.jpeg 474w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MuggleNet-New-York-Times-Clue-139x300.jpeg 139w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MuggleNet-New-York-Times-Clue-150x324.jpeg 150w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MuggleNet-New-York-Times-Clue-600x1297.jpeg 600w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MuggleNet-New-York-Times-Clue-520x1124.jpeg 520w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MuggleNet-New-York-Times-Clue.jpeg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer, of course, was &#8220;fansite.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>10. MuggleNet Live! 2017: 19 Years Later</h4>
<p>On September 1, 2017, the <em>Harry Potter</em> fandom marked a significant date: the day and year on which the Epilogue takes place. MuggleNet threw a private party after hours in The Wizarding World of Harry Potter &#8211; Diagon Alley at Universal Studios Florida. Hundreds of fans showed up to celebrate the event, hobnobbing with cast members, eating as much butterbeer ice cream as they could take, and of course, boarding the Hogwarts Express from Platform 9 ¾.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_1282215" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1282215" class="size-full wp-image-1282215" src="http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_6185.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="540" srcset="http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_6185.jpg 960w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_6185-300x169.jpg 300w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_6185-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_6185-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_6185-600x338.jpg 600w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_6185-520x293.jpg 520w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1282215" class="wp-caption-text">MuggleNet staff members and <em>Harry Potter</em> actors celebrate a successful event after MuggleNet Live! 2017: 19 Years Later.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Special <em>Potter</em> guests at the event were Sean Biggerstaff (Oliver Wood), Chris Rankin (Percy Weasley), Christian Coulson (Tom Riddle), Rohan Gotobed (young Sirius Black), Ellie Darcey-Alden (young Lily Potter), and Ryan Turner (Hugo Weasley).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>11. MuggleNet on the <em>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</em> Red Carpet</h4>
<p>MuggleNet has been on our share of red carpets, but there&#8217;s something about fans lined up against the barricades chanting &#8220;MuggleNet, MuggleNet,&#8221; that still gives us chills.</p>
<p>At the red carpet for the <em>Half-Blood Prince</em> film premiere, Emerson Spartz interviewed cast and crew members. There&#8217;s a really great exchange between Emerson and Daniel Radcliffe where they greet each other like old friends before diving into questions about the toughest scenes to film and what moments Dan was looking forward to filming in the next movie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>12. Exclusive Partnership with <em>Newsweek</em></h4>
<p>In October 2016, MuggleNet teamed up with <em>Newsweek</em>, contributing stories for their entirely <em>Potter</em> special edition. MuggleNet staff contributed two articles to the magazine.</p>
<blockquote><p>Getting to write an article for <em>Newsweek</em> was an honor and huge learning experience. I had never before written for a publication the caliber of <em>Newsweek</em>. It was quite the magical experience to submit ‘Generation Potter’, work with the editors, and then see it in print. When it was published, I ran out to Barnes &amp; Noble and snapped pictures with the edition. I look forward to sharing the article with my kids one day and discussing how the <em>Harry Potter</em> stories shaped their generation.</p>
<p>– Nicole Rivera, Former Creative Team Manager</p></blockquote>
<p>That issue of the magazine was re-released the following year, and since that first partnership, we’ve helped <em>Newsweek</em> put together two more special editions focusing on the wizarding world.</p>

<h4>13. Back on the Red Carpet for <em>Fantastic Beasts</em></h4>
<p>Like we&#8217;ve said before, MuggleNet is no rookie when it comes to red carpets, but there was something truly thrilling about being back at a premiere for a wizarding world film years after we thought there would be no more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmugglenet%2Fvideos%2F10157683862890075%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the A-listers were out in full force in New York City for the <em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</em> film premiere, including J.K. Rowling herself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>14. MuggleNet in the News</h4>
<p>MuggleNet has appeared in major publications and on network news several times throughout the years. Our resume includes appearances on <em>CBS</em>, <em>Fox News</em>, <em>BBC</em>, and <em>Al Jazeera</em>, as well as mentions in the<em> New York Times</em>, <em>Washington Post</em>, <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, and the<em> Wall Street Journal</em>, to name a few.</p>
<blockquote><p>A worldwide quest to help everybody learn to capitalize the &#8220;N&#8221; in MuggleNet cannot succeed without good press. Through the many times MuggleNet has appeared in the news these last 20 years, proper spelling of our name is something we&#8217;re almost as passionate about as we are of <em>Harry Potter</em>! And the channels that get it right are bae &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3</p>
<p>– Eric Scull, Senior Contributing Editor</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>15. April Fools&#8217; Pranks That Really Got People</h4>
<p>If you’re a veteran MuggleNet follower, you’ve probably learned by this point to check your calendar before believing an article that seems unbelievable. Our staff has come up with some doozies for April Fools&#8217; Day over the years, some of which still circulate around the Internet from time to time. Our 2013 prank claiming Emma Watson had been cast as Ariel in a live-action version of <em>The Little Mermaid</em> even prompted a Snopes Fact Check. MuggleNet staffers even went so far as to Photoshop an image of Watson as Ariel to accompany the article.</p>
<blockquote><p>The image seemed to really sell it because the story spread far and wide across the Internet. A year later, the first word of a real live-action Little Mermaid being in the works seemed to breathe new life into the Emma-as-Ariel rumor. The rumor and image still seem to pop up from time to time, with one live-action Little Mermaid released in 2018 and two more still in the works.</p>
<p>– Catherine Lai, Senior News Administrator &amp; Copy Editor</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>16. MuggleNet Gets a &#8220;Thank You&#8221; for Coming to J.K. Rowling&#8217;s Defense</h4>
<p>In May 2006, controversy erupted in the <em>Harry Potter</em> fandom, with claims that all overweight <em>Potter</em> characters were depicted as evil. MuggleNet staff member, Andy, compiled a list to prove that was not entirely accurate. J.K. Rowling thanked him by name on her website, saying he saved her precious time that she then spent writing the final chapter of the final <em>Harry Potter</em> book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>17. MuggleNet Quoted on Posters for Off-Broadway Show <em>Puffs</em></h4>
<p>When you have a <em>Harry Potter</em> parody show opening Off-Broadway and you need some reviews, who ya gonna call? MuggleNet, of course. When <em>Puffs, or Seven Increasingly Eventful Years at a Certain School of Magic and Magic</em> was playing off-Broadway, MuggleNet was invited to see the show and pen a review. Words from that rave review are still used on the show&#8217;s marketing materials all over New York City.</p>
<blockquote><p>Anytime I’m lucky to be asked to handle review coverage I feel honored, but to actually find out that my review was so highly appreciated and coveted that a show would use it in its marketing materials is next level. I’ll never forget when I first found out my words were in print and blown up on subway ads.</p>
<p>– Lizzie Sudlow, Internship Coordinator</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>18. MuggleNet Live! 2015: Expo Patronum</h4>
<p>In April 2015 MuggleNet hosted its first-ever convention: MuggleNet Live! 2015: Expo Patronum. The event was held in London and was a chance for fans to interact with each other and cast members from the film series in an intimate setting. The guest list included Anna Shaffer, Afshan Azad, Georgina Leonidas, Jessie Cave, Natalia Tena, Robbie Jarvis, Nick Shirm, Harry Melling, Chris Rankin, Jon Campling, Nick Moran, Gary Tomkins, Eduardo Lima, and Miraphora Mina.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>19. A Social Media Frenzy Surrounds Mysterious Globus Mundi Theme Park Merch</h4>
<p>When MuggleNet staff members spotted mysterious new merchandise in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter Universal Orlando Resorts, it sparked a flurry of questions from fans across Twitter. Subsequently, MuggleNet was the first to report that a new store would be opening in Diagon Alley: Globus Mundi Travel Agents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="video-container"><iframe title="Globus Mundi Travel Agents: A Theme Park Mystery" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lV5IlKsx0pk?feature=oembed&#038;wmode=opaque&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=http://www.mugglenet.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the course of our investigation, we stumbled upon a Globus Mundi Facebook page and Twitter account. Within 10 hours of our initial article pointing out the abundance of merchandise dedicated to the travel agency, the Globus Mundi Twitter account went from 6 followers to over 140, again showing just how influential &#8220;mighty MuggleNet&#8221; can be.</p>
<p>We’re still not sure who owns the probably-not-so-official social media account, but we’re hoping that’s the next mystery that’s uncovered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>20. Site Staff Quadrupled</h4>
<p>In 2011 MuggleNet quadrupled the size of its staff by introducing internships. With the fandom in a transition period after the last film released, we needed to rethink our structure. In order to keep up with creating engaging and timely content, we needed more minds on board. Today, we have 130 staff members and 32 interns working on the site.</p>

<p>As we count down to the final days of our anniversary celebration, we have a really amazing offer for everyone who wasn&#8217;t able to attend our events in New York City at the beginning of October.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past weekend was the tenth anniversary of LeakyCon and <a href="http://www.mugglenet.com/2019/10/leakycon-boston-2019-a-recap-of-the-final-day/">MuggleNet was there</a> celebrating. It was an amazing weekend filled with hilarious panels, incredible wizard rock, and heartwarming experiences. If you weren&#8217;t able to make it, here&#8217;s everything you missed.</p>
<p>Many of us in attendance were actually at <a href="http://www.mugglenet.com/2019/10/seven-magical-takeaways-a-leakycon-boston-recap/">LeakyCon for the first time</a>! We were amazed by the amazing cosplay as well as the merchandise in the Marketplace. Anything you can think of was on offer by creatives from all around the world. Anything from customizable prints to Hogwarts House scented candles to clothing and accessories. Trust us, you cannot walk out empty-handed!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_1292635" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1292635" class="wp-image-1292635" src="http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/LeakyCon-Boston-Vendors-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800" srcset="http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/LeakyCon-Boston-Vendors-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/LeakyCon-Boston-Vendors-225x300.jpg 225w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/LeakyCon-Boston-Vendors-150x200.jpg 150w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/LeakyCon-Boston-Vendors-600x800.jpg 600w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/LeakyCon-Boston-Vendors-520x693.jpg 520w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1292635" class="wp-caption-text">LeakyCon Boston Marketplace vendors in cosplay selling wands, Hogwarts House quills, and Mandrakes</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although there is a new generation of the fandom emerging, the convention celebrated a community of wizards and witches from all walks of life, shattering the age line for all to enter. In the panels where we examined the canon, the multiple perspectives and interpretations were astounding, especially when looking at the security of Hogwarts and the true meaning behind the &#8220;<em>Always&#8221; </em>phenomenon.</p>
<p>On Friday night, we wrocked hard at the amazing wizard rock concert. The wrock concert is a LeakyCon tradition and it was easy to see why. It was an incredible experience as wrock musicians came together to create an inspiring night of music. The night included performances by Lauren Fairweather, Tonks and the Aurors, Draco and the Malfoys, and Harry and the Potters. The Potters, in particular, put on a hilarious and wonderful show, complete with props and hilarious gags.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_1292580" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Harry-and-the-Potters-Leaky10-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1292580" class="wp-image-1292580 size-large" src="http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Harry-and-the-Potters-Leaky10-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Harry-and-the-Potters-Leaky10-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Harry-and-the-Potters-Leaky10-1-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Harry-and-the-Potters-Leaky10-1-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Harry-and-the-Potters-Leaky10-1-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Harry-and-the-Potters-Leaky10-1-600x450.jpg 600w, http://www.mugglenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Harry-and-the-Potters-Leaky10-1-520x390.jpg 520w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1292580" class="wp-caption-text">Harry under his &#8220;invisibility cloak.&#8221;</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But beyond just being a fun night, the wrock concert also served as a call to action for the attendees. We were inspired by the Potters to go out and do good in the world and make a change and listening to all the amazing music definitely motivated us to do so. <a href="http://www.mugglenet.com/2019/10/music-is-magic-at-leakycon10s-wizard-rock-concert/">The whole experience</a> was a blast.</p>
<p>On Saturday night, Leaky guests were cordially invited to the Esther Earl Ball. Everyone put on their fanciest cosplay and <em>Potter</em>-themed formalwear and danced the night away. Fans recreated dances from the Yule Ball and chased away the Nargles like the Lovegoods to a soundtrack of all our favorite songs. When the night reached its end, the con staff took to the stage for the traditional singing of <em>Total Eclipse of the Heart</em>, which happens every year as a tribute to the con&#8217;s origins.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mugglenet.com/2019/10/leakycon-boston-2019-a-recap-of-the-final-day/">Wrapping up the con on Sunday</a>, we spent the day sitting in on panels with featured actors Chris Rankin and Dan Fogler, as well as continuing to take in all that the Marketplace had to offer. Wishing we had a Time-Turner like Hermione in order to sit in on multiple panels at once, we attended the panels titled &#8220;Obscurus and Patronus: Expressions of the Soul in the Wizarding World&#8221; and &#8220;In Defense of <em>Prisoner of Azkaban</em>, the Best <em>Harry Potter</em> Movie.&#8221; As evidenced by the plethora of panels on the LeakyCon schedule, the <em>Potter</em> series continues to inspire thoughtful analyses and theorizing!</p>

<p>Overall, LeakyCon10! was definitely a success. We all had an amazing time hanging out with other huge <em>Potter</em> nerds and the panels, events, and vendors were incredible. Sadly, the con is over, but we&#8217;ll see everyone in <a href="https://www.leakycon.com/orlando-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orlando next year</a>!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that everyone has calmed down and accepted that Robert Pattinson is most likely going to be a pretty excellent Batman, attention is turning to his supporting cast. And we wizarding world fans have cause for even more rejoicing this week after it was announced that Zoë Kravitz would be joining the villainous faction of that crew.</p>
<p><a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/the-batman-zoe-kravitz-catwoman-1203302757/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Variety</em> broke the news</a> that Kravitz has signed on to Matt Reeves&#8217; <em>The Batman</em> in the role of Catwoman. Of additional interest is the fact that <em>Variety</em> said the actress won the role over Zazie Beetz (<em>Joker</em>), Eiza González (<em>Baby Driver</em>), and Alicia Vikander (<em>Tomb Raider</em>) despite concerns over <em>&#8220;scheduling issues&#8221;</em> with <em>Fantastic Beasts</em>. That seems to indicate, as has been oft-discussed, that Kravitz will be returning to the role of Leta Lestrange in <em>Fantastic Beasts 3</em>, even if only in flashback form.</p>
<p>Kravitz, who most recently appeared in the second season of <em>Big Little Lies</em>, received immediate support from stepfather Jason Momoa and Anne Hathaway, who donned Catwoman&#8217;s skin-tight black leather in 2012&#8217;s <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>.</p>

<p>Pattinson, meanwhile, <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/features/robert-pattinson-batman-the-lighthouse-1203319866/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spoke recently with <em>Variety</em></a> about landing the role of Batman, saying he initially thought he&#8217;d lost it before he&#8217;d even auditioned due to the fact that rumors of his casting began swirling in mid-May. That led to a stressful flight from Los Angeles, California, to the Cannes Film Festival in France, during which Pattinson scoured the Internet for any indication the rumors had cost him his shot at the role.</p>
<blockquote><p>When that thing leaked, I was f***ing furious. Everyone was so upset. Everyone was panicking from my team. I sort of thought that had blown up the whole thing. [&#8230;] I was sitting next to [American screenwriter] Christopher McQuarrie. I&#8217;d never met him before. Oh, God! He&#8217;d seen me Googling myself for the past hour!</p></blockquote>
<p>McQuarrie assured the actor he&#8217;d probably have been doing the same, and by May 31, Pattinson&#8217;s casting <a href="http://www.mugglenet.com/2019/05/its-official-robert-pattinson-is-your-next-caped-crusader/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was official</a>. Having just finished up <em>The Lighthouse</em> and in the midst of filming for Christopher Nolan&#8217;s <em>Tenet</em>, that&#8217;s made for a busy schedule, but the actor says he&#8217;s thrilled to join the pantheon of past Batmen. Pattinson divulged that, as a child, Batman was <em>&#8220;the only outfit I had,&#8221;</em> but he wouldn&#8217;t let slip how he made use of that outfit. <em>&#8220;If I actually said it in an interview, I would definitely have a lot of abuse afterwards,&#8221;</em> he said. <em>&#8220;If I successfully play the character, I can say it at the end.&#8221;</em> We&#8217;re holding him to that!</p>
<p>As is the case anytime anyone is cast in any role another person has played before, there was a bit of initial backlash to Pattinson&#8217;s casting, but he wasn&#8217;t put off, telling <em>Variety</em>, <em>&#8220;To be honest, it was less vitriolic than I was expecting. It&#8217;s much more fun when you&#8217;re an underdog. There&#8217;s no expectation of you.&#8221;</em> Pattinson also admitted that he&#8217;d been hoping to have the opportunity to don the cowl for longer than anyone knew.</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;d had &#8216;Batman&#8217; in my mind for a while. It&#8217;s such an absurd thing to say. I sort of had an idea to do it, and I&#8217;d been prodding Matt. He didn&#8217;t accept any prods. I kept asking to meet him. [&#8230;] And then I had to kind of try to imagine what he&#8217;d written, and I hadn&#8217;t even read the script. I&#8217;d come with this pad full of notes.</p></blockquote>
<p>He additionally confirmed something we&#8217;ve all assumed: While the Batsuit looks incomparably cool once it&#8217;s on, getting into it is probably the exact opposite of cool. Just imagine how Kravitz is going to feel!</p>
<blockquote><p>I put it on. I remember saying to Matt, &#8216;It does feel quite transformative!&#8217; He was like, &#8216;I would hope it does! You&#8217;re literally in the Batsuit.&#8217; You do feel very powerful immediately. And it&#8217;s pretty astonishing, something that is incredibly difficult to get into, so the ritual of getting into it is pretty humiliating. You&#8217;ve got five people trying to shove you into something. Once you&#8217;ve got it on, it&#8217;s like, &#8216;Yeah, I feel strong, I feel tough, even though I had to have someone squeezing my butt cheeks into the legs.</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you need a magical animal movie to enjoy before the release of the next installment of the <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> franchise? Robert Downey Jr. might be the star of the upcoming <em>Dolittle</em> movie, but listen carefully and you&#8217;re sure to spot a few <a href="http://www.mugglenet.com/2019/10/social-media-roundup-sorting-ceremonies-and-family-photos/">Wizarding World alumni</a> among the cast.</p>
<p><em>Dolittle </em>tells the story of the<a href="https://comicbook.com/movies/2019/10/12/robert-downey-jr-dolittle-poster-first-look/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> infamous veterinarian</a>, who in this adaptation has become a recluse after the death of his wife. However, Dr. John Dolittle (played by Robert Downey Jr.) is called into action when a young Queen Victoria falls ill. Setting sail on an &#8220;<em>epic journey</em>&#8221; with his menagerie of animals for company, Dr. Dolittle faces a number of adventures and friends and foes in his search to find a cure for the Queen.</p>

<p>Starring alongside Downey Jr. on-screen is Ralph Ineson (Amycus Carrow) as Arnall Stubbins and Jim Broadbent (Professor Slughorn) in an as yet unknown role.</p>
<p>Lending their voice acting talent to the movie is Dame Emma Thompson (Professor Trelawney), Ralph Fiennes (Voldemort), Carmen Ejogo (President Seraphina Picquery), and France de la Tour (Madame Maxime).</p>
<p>Thompson will voice the role of a parrot named Polynesia, whereas Fiennes and Ejogo will take on the roles of Barry the tiger and Regine the lioness. De la Tour will be voicing a character called Ginko-Who-Soars, but it has not been confirmed what animal (if it even is an aminal) this character is.</p>
<p><em>Dolittle</em> is set for release on January 17. 2020. Check out the trailer for the movie below.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ready to play wizard chess with Ron and Harry? What about helping Hagrid bring in a giant evergreen or helping Professor Flitwick decorate? However you ready yourself for the winter holidays, celebrate with <a href="https://insighteditions.com/product/harry-potter-a-hogwarts-christmas-pop-up/?utm_source=Press%20Release%20PreOrders&amp;utm_medium=Press%20Release&amp;utm_campaign=Fall%202019%20Harry%20Potter%20Press%20Release%20-%20Christmas%20Pop%20Up"><em>Harry Potter: A Hogwarts Christmas Pop-Up</em> from Insight Editions</a>! Available this month, this one-of-a-kind book recreates the Christmas spirit seen in the Great Hall. This must-have collectible is filled with keepsakes of elements from the <em>Harry Potter </em>films and can be used to decorate the centerfold pop-up tree. Our very own Lacey Villareal, a Graphic Designer at MuggleNet, was able to review a copy, so take a peek and get ready for a magical winter season.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For many of us, <em>Harry Potter</em> is synonymous with the holidays. Perhaps it’s because of the time of year the movies came out, or perhaps it’s the wonderful scenes in <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone</em> of Harry having his first real Christmas with Ron that cemented it for all of us as a Christmas favorite. Either way, we can all agree that <em>Harry Potter</em> and Christmas go hand in hand. Upon hearing that there was a magical Christmas pop-up book, I instantly knew that I must own this product. Originally assuming from the name that this product was a pop-up storybook, I was surprised to discover that it was, in fact, an Advent calendar!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you first open the book, you will be pleasantly surprised to discover that the pop-up aspect is in actuality a giant Christmas tree that has been situated at the front of the Great Hall, alongside Professors Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall. Similar to a standard Advent calendar, this pop-up has numbered “boxes” to open leading up to Christmas with trinkets inside. Unlike a normal Advent calendar, these 25 (one more than standard!) numbered “boxes” are filled with beautiful ornaments that you will use in order to decorate the giant tree. Upon opening the “box” labeled “1,” I discovered the only obvious first prize in the wizarding world, Harry’s Hogwarts acceptance letter. I was presently surprised at the sturdiness of these openings, meaning that, unlike with a regular Advent calendar, these “boxes” can be closed again completely, meaning you’ll be able to replace the ornaments after the holiday season and use it again each year!</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will also find with this product a bonus unnumbered “box,” containing a behind-the-scenes book on Christmas at Hogwarts. This book has images and stories alike for you to enjoy alongside your new favorite Christmas tree.</p>
<p>I honestly can’t say enough good things about this book, from the art to the attention to detail in the tree and ornaments — this would be the perfect gift for the witch, wizard, or Muggle in your life! I can already tell that this book is going to be a new favorite holiday tradition in my house, and I honestly can’t wait for Christmas so I can now imagine that I am celebrating at Hogwarts (as if I didn’t before <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />)!</p>
