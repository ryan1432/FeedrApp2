2. Choose `Import Third-Party Git Repository`
3. Enter the URL `https://github.com/sdepold/feedrapp.git`
4. Specify a target fork repository
5. Wait for the deployment to finish

### Test your new service

Over at the dashboard area, you will your app's Vercel URL (e.g. https://feedrapp-clone-x.vercel.app). Using that
